<p>I was employed as an officer of the Quartermaster-general’s
department, for several years, in
the province of Cutch. In the course of enquiries
into its geography and history, I visited
the eastern mouth of the Indus, to which the
country adjoins, as well as that singular tract
called the “Run,” into which that river flows.
The extension of our knowledge in that quarter
served only to excite further curiosity, in which
I was stimulated by Lieut-General Sir Thomas
Bradford, then Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay
army. That officer directed his views, in a
most enlightened manner, to the acquisition of
every information regarding a frontier so important
to Britain as that of north-western India.
Encouraged by such approbation, for which I
am deeply grateful, I volunteered my services,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
in the year 1829, to traverse the deserts between
India and the Indus, and finally, endeavour to
descend that river to the sea. Such a journey
involved matters of political moment; but the
government of Bombay was then held by an individual
distinguished above all others, by zeal
in the cause of Asiatic geography and literature.
Sir John Malcolm despatched me at once, in
prosecution of the design, and was pleased to
remove me to the political branch of the service,
observing, that I should be then invested “with
influence with the rulers, through whose
country I travelled, that would tend greatly
to allay that jealousy and alarm, which might
impede, if they did not arrest, the progress of
my enquiries.”</p>

<p>In the year 1830, I entered the desert, accompanied
by Lieut. James Holland, of the
Quartermaster-general’s department, an officer
ably qualified to assist me. After reaching
Jaysulmeer, we were overtaken by an express
from the Supreme Government of India, desiring
us to return, since at that time “it was deemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
inexpedient to incur the hazard of exciting
the alarm and jealousy of the rulers of Sinde,
and other foreign states, by the prosecution of
the design.” This disappointment, then most
acutely felt, was dissipated in the following year,
by the arrival of presents from the King of Great
Britain for the ruler of Lahore, coupled, at the
same time, with the desire that such an opportunity
for acquiring correct information of the
Indus should not be overlooked. The following
work contains the narrative of that mission,
which I conducted by the Indus to Lahore.
The information which I collected, relative to
Jaysulmeer and the countries on the N. W. frontier
of India, has just been published in the
Transactions of the Royal Geographical Society
of London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of
presents
from the
King of
England
for Runjeet
Sing
at Lahore.</div>

<p>In the year 1830, a ship arrived at Bombay,
with a present of five horses from the King
of Great Britain to Maharaja Runjeet Sing,
the Seik Chieftain at Lahore, accompanied by
a letter of friendship from his majesty’s minister<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
to that prince. At the recommendation
of Major-General Sir John Malcolm, then governor
of Bombay, I had the honour of being
nominated by the Supreme Government of India
to proceed on a mission to the Seik capital, with
these presents, by way of the river Indus. I
held at that time a political situation in Cutch,
the only portion of the British dominions in
India which borders on the Indus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Information
on the
Indus desiderated.</div>

<p>The authorities, both in England and India,
contemplated that much information of a political
and geographical nature might be acquired
in such a journey. The knowledge which we
possessed of the Indus was vague and unsatis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>factory,
and the only accounts of a great portion
of its course were drawn from Arrian, Curtius,
and the other historians of Alexander’s expedition.
Sir John Malcolm thus minuted in the
records of government, in August, <span class="lock">1830:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The navigation of the Indus is important in
every point of view; yet we have no information
that can be depended upon on this subject,
except of about seventy miles from Tatta
to Hyderabad. Of the present state of the
Delta we have native accounts, and the only
facts which can be deduced are, that the different
streams of the river below Tatta, often
change their channels, and that the sands of
all are constantly shifting; but, notwithstanding
these difficulties, boats of a small draft of
water can always go up the principal of them.
With regard to the Indus above Hyderabad,
there can be no doubt of its being, as it has
been for more than two thousand years, navigable
far up.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrangements.</div>

<p>In addition therefore to the complimentary
mission on which I was to be employed, I had
my attention most specially directed to the acquisition
of full and complete information regarding
the Indus. This was a matter of no
easy accomplishment, as the Ameers, or rulers
of Sinde, had ever evinced the utmost jealousy
of Europeans, and none of the missions which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
visited the country had been permitted to proceed
beyond their capital of Hyderabad. The river
Indus, likewise, in its course to the ocean, traverses
the territories of many lawless and barbarous
tribes, from whom both opposition and
insult might be dreaded. On these matters much
valuable advice was derived from Lieutenant-Colonel
Henry Pottinger, political resident in
Cutch, and well known to the world for his
adventurous travels in Beloochistan. He suggested
that it might allay the fears of the Sinde
government, if a large carriage were sent with
the horses, since the size and bulk of it would
render it obvious that the mission could then
only proceed by water. This judicious proposal
was immediately adopted by government;
nor was it in this case alone that the experience
of Colonel Pottinger availed me, as it will be
seen that he evinced the most unwearied zeal
throughout the difficulties which presented themselves,
and contributed, in a great degree, to the
ultimate success of the undertaking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The escort.</div>

<p>That a better colour might also be given to my
deputation by a route so unfrequented, I was made
the bearer of presents to the Ameers of Sinde,
and at the same time charged with communications
of a political nature to them. These referred
to some excesses committed by their
subjects on the British frontier; but I was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>formed
that neither that, nor any other negotiation,
was to detain me in my way to Lahore.
The authorities in England had desired that a
suitable escort might accompany the party; but
though the design was not free from some degree
of danger, it was evident that no party of
any moderate detail could afford the necessary
protection. I preferred, therefore, the absence
of any of our troops, and resolved to trust to the
people of the country; believing that, through
their means, I might form a link of communication
with the inhabitants. Sir John Malcolm
observed, in his letter to the Governor General,
that “the guard will be people of the country
he visits, and those familiar with it. Lieut.
Burnes prefers such, on the justest grounds, to
any others; finding they facilitate his progress,
while they disarm that jealousy which
the appearance of any of our troops excites.”
Nor were my sentiments erroneous; since a
guard of wild Beloochees protected us in Sinde,
and allayed suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appointed
to conduct
the mission
to Lahore.</div>

<p>When these preliminary arrangements had
been completed, I received my final instructions
in a secret letter from the chief secretary at
Bombay. I was informed that “the depth of
water in the Indus, the direction and breadth
of the stream, its facilities for steam navigation,
the supply of fuel on its banks, and the con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>dition
of the princes and people who possess
the country bordering on it, are all points of
the highest interest to government; but your
own knowledge and reflection will suggest to
you various other particulars, in which full
information is highly desirable; and the slow
progress of the boats up the Indus will, it is
hoped, give you every opportunity to pursue
your researches.” I was supplied with all the
requisite surveying instruments, and desired to
draw bills on honour for my expenses. In a
spirit also purely characteristic of the distinguished
individual who then held the government,
I received the thanks of Sir John Malcolm
for my previous services; had my attention
drawn to the confidence now reposed in me;
and was informed that my knowledge of the
neighbouring countries and the character of
their inhabitants, with the local impressions by
which I was certain to be aided, gave me advantages
which no other individual enjoyed, and
had led to my selection; nor could I but be
stimulated by the manner in which Sir John
Malcolm addressed the Governor General of
India:&mdash;“I shall be very confident of any
plan Lieut. Burnes undertakes in this quarter
of India; provided a latitude is given him to
act as circumstances may dictate, I dare
pledge myself that the public interests will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
promoted. Having had my attention much
directed, and not without success, during
more than thirty years, to the exploring and
surveying countries in Asia, I have gained
some experience, not only in the qualities and
habits of the individuals by whom such enterprises
can be undertaken, but of the pretexts
and appearances necessary to give them success.”
A young active and intelligent officer,
Ensign J. D. Leckie, of the 22d Regiment N.I.,
was also nominated to accompany me; a surveyor,
a native doctor, and suitable establishments
of servants were likewise entertained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departure
from Cutch.</div>

<p>We sailed from Mandivee in Cutch with a
fleet of five native boats, on the morning of the
21st of January, 1831. On the day succeeding
our departure, we had cleared the Gulf of Cutch.
The danger in navigating it has been exaggerated.
The eddies and dirty appearance of the
sea, which boils up and bubbles like an effervescing
draught, present a frightful aspect to a
stranger, but the natives traverse it at all seasons.
It is tolerably free from rocks, and the Cutch
shore is sandy with little surf, and presents inducements
for vessels in distress to run in upon
the land. We passed a boat of fifty tons, which
had escaped shipwreck, with a very valuable
cargo from Mozambique, the preceding year, by
this expedient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ability of
the Cutch
navigators.</div>

<p>Among the timid navigators of the East, the
mariner of Cutch is truly adventurous; he voyages
to Arabia, the Red Sea, and the coast of
Zanguebar in Africa, bravely stretching out on
the ocean after quitting his native shore. The
“moallim” or pilot determines his position by
an altitude at noon or by the stars at night, with
a rude quadrant. Coarse charts depict to him the
bearings of his destination, and, by long-tried
seamanship, he weathers, in an undecked boat
with a huge lateen sail, the dangers and tornadoes
of the Indian Ocean. This use of the quadrant
was taught by a native of Cutch, who made a
voyage to Holland in the middle of last century,
and returned, “in a green old age,” to enlighten
his country with the arts and sciences of Europe.
The most substantial advantages introduced by
this improver of his country were the arts of
navigating and naval architecture, in which the
inhabitants of Cutch excel. For a trifling reward,
a Cutch mariner will put to sea in the
rainy season, and the adventurous feeling is
encouraged by the Hindoo merchants of Mandivee,
an enterprising and speculating body of
men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival in
the Indus.</div>

<p>On the evening of the 24th we had cleared
the Gulf of Cutch, and anchored in the mouth of
the Koree, the eastern, though forsaken, branch
of the Indus, which separates Sinde from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Cutch. The Koree leads to Lueput, and is
the largest of all the mouths of the river, having
become a branch of the sea as the fresh water
has been turned from its channel. There are
many spots on its banks hallowed in the estimation
of the people. Cotasir and Narainseer are
places of pilgrimage to the Hindoo, and stand
upon it and the western promontory of Cutch.
Opposite them lies the cupola of Rao Kanoje,
beneath which there rests a saint, revered by the
Mahommedans. To defraud this personage of
frankincense, grain, oil, and money, in navigating
the Koree, would entail, it is superstitiously
believed, certain shipwreck. In the reverence we
recognise the dangers and fear of the mariner.
There is a great contrast between the shores of
Sinde and Cutch; the one is flat and depressed,
nearly to a level with the sea, while the hills of
Cutch rise in wild and volcanic cones, which
meet the eye long after the coast has faded
from the view. We gladly exchanged this
grandeur for the dull monotony of the shores of
Sinde, unvaried, as it is, by any other signs of
vegetation than stunted shrubs, whose domain is
invaded by each succeeding tide.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Coast of
Sinde.</div>

<p>We followed the Sinde coast for four or five
days, passing all the mouths of the Indus, eleven
in number, the principal of which we entered
and examined, without even the observation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
inhabitants. There was little indication of our
being near the estuary of so great a river, for the
water was only fresh a mile off shore from the
Gora, or largest mouth of the Indus; and the
junction of the river water with that of the
sea was formed without violence, and might
be now and then discovered by a small streak
of foam and a gentle ripple. The number and
subdivision of the branches diminish, no doubt,
the velocity as well as the volume of the Indus;
but it would be supposed that so vast a river
would exercise an influence in the sea far from its
embouchure; and, I believe, this is really the
case in the months of July and August, during
the inundation. The waters of the Indus are so
loaded with mud and clay, as to discolour the sea
for about three miles from the land. Opposite
its different mouths numberless brown specks
are to be seen, called “pit” by the natives.
I found them, on examination, to be round
globules, filled with water, and easily burst.
When placed on a plate, they were about the
size of a shilling, and covered by a brown skin.
These specks are considered by the pilots to denote
the presence of fresh water among the salt;
for they believe them to be detached from the
sand banks, by the meeting of the sea and the
river. They give a particularly dirty and oily
appearance to the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Anchor on
the Indus.</div>

<p>At night-fall on the 28th, we cast anchor in
the western mouth of the Indus, called the
Pittee. The coast of Sinde is not distinguishable
a league from the shore. There is not
a tree to be seen, though the mirage sometimes
magnifies the stunted shrubs of the Delta,
and gives them a tall and verdant appearance;
a delusion that vanishes with a nearer approach.
From our anchorage, a white fortified tomb, in
the Bay of Curachee, was visible north-west of us;
and beyond it lay a rocky range of black mountains,
called Hala, the Irus of Nearchus. I here
read from Arrian and Quintus Curtius the passages
of this memorable scene in Alexander’s
expedition, the mouth from which his admiral,
Nearchus, took his departure from Sinde. The
river did not exceed 500 yards in width, instead
of the 200 stadia (furlongs) of Arrian,
and the twelve miles, which more modern accounts
had assigned to it, on the authority of
the natives. But there was still some resemblance
to the Greek author; for the hills over
Curachee form with the intervening country
a semicircular bay, in which an island and
some sand-banks might lead a stranger to believe,
that the ocean was yet distant. “Alexander
sent two long galleys before the fleet,
towards the ocean, to view a certain island,
which they called Cillutas, where his pilots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
told him he might go on shore before he entered
the main ocean; and when they assured
him that it was a large island, and had commodious
harbours, besides plenty of fresh water,
he commanded the rest of the fleet to put in
there, while he himself passed out to sea.”
The island, as it now exists, is scantily covered
with herbage, and destitute of fresh water. In
vain I sought an identity of name in the Indian
dialect, for it was nameless; but it presented a
safe place of anchorage; and, as I looked upon
it, I could not but think it was that Cillutas
where the hero of Macedon, “drawing up his
fleet under a promontory, sacrificed to the
gods, as he had received orders from Ammon.”
Here it was, too, that Nearchus caused “a canal
to be dug, of about five stadia in length, where
the earth was easiest to remove; as soon as
the tide began to rise they got their whole
fleet safe through that passage into the ocean.”
The Greek admiral only availed himself of the
experience of the people; for it is yet customary
among the natives of Sinde to dig shallow
canals, and leave the tides or river to deepen
them; and a distance of five stadia, or half a
mile, would call for no great labour. It is not
to be supposed that sand-banks will continue
unaltered for centuries; but I may observe, that
there was a large bank contiguous to the island,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
between it and which a passage like that of
Nearchus might have been dug with the greatest
advantage. “Having sailed from the mouth
of the Indus, Nearchus came to a sandy island,
called Crocola, and proceeded on his voyage,
having the mountain Irus on his right hand.”
The topography is here more accurate: two
sandy islands, called Andry, lie off Curachee,
at a distance of eighteen miles from the Indus;
and it is worthy of remark, that that portion of
the Delta through which the Pittee runs, is yet
denominated “Crocola” by the natives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ebb and
flow of the
tides.</div>

<p>But the ebb and flow of the tides were an
object of the greatest surprise to Alexander’s
fleet, and we could soon discover the cause of
their astonishment, for two of our boats stranded
at a spot where, half an hour previously, there
had been abundance of water. The tides inundate
the country with great impetuosity, and recede
as rapidly, so that if a vessel be not in the
channel, she will be left on shore. Arrian observes,
that “while they continued in that station,
an accident happened which astonished
them; namely, the ebbing and flowing of the
waters, like as in the great ocean, inasmuch
that the ships were left upon dry ground,
which Alexander and his friends never having
perceived before, were so much the more
surprised. But what increased their astonish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>ment
was, that the tide returning a short
while after began to heave the ships, so that
* * * some of them were swept away by
the fury of the tide, and dashed to pieces,
and others driven against the bank, and destroyed.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Quintus
Curtius’s
description
of Alexander’s
disasters.</div>

<p>A graphic and animated description of these
disasters of the Greeks has been likewise given
by Quintus Curtius, and is nowhere more remarkable
than in the allusion to the “knolls”
rising above the river like “little islands,” for
at full tide the mangrove shrubs present exactly
that appearance; but let the author speak in his
own <span class="lock">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“About the third hour, the ocean, according
to a regular alternation, began to flow in furiously,
driving back the river. The river, at
first, resisted; then impressed with a new
force, rushed upwards with more impetuosity
than torrents descend a precipitous channel.
The mass on board, unacquainted with the nature
of the tide, saw only prodigies and symbols
of the wrath of the gods. Ever and anon the
sea swelled; and on plains, recently dry, descended
a diffused flood. The vessels lifted
from their stations, and the whole fleet dispersed;
those who had debarked, in terror
and astonishment at the calamity, ran from all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
quarters towards the ships. But tumultuous
hurry is slow. * * * Vessels dash together,
and oars are by turns snatched away, to impel
other galleys. A spectator would not imagine
a fleet carrying the same army; but hostile
navies commencing a battle. * * * * Now
the tide had inundated all the fields skirting
the river, only <i>tops of knolls</i> rising above it
like little islands; to these, from the evacuated
ships, the majority swam in consternation.
The dispersed fleet was partly riding in deep
water, where the land was depressed into
dells; and partly resting on shoals, where the
tide had covered elevated ground; suddenly
breaks on the Macedonians a new alarm more
vivid than the former. The sea began to ebb;
the deluge, with a violent drain, to retreat
into the frith, disclosing tracts just before
deeply buried. Unbayed, the ships pitched
some upon their prows, others upon their
sides. The fields were strewed with baggage,
arms, loose planks, and fragments of oars. The
soldiers scarcely believed what they suffered
and witnessed. Shipwrecks on dry land, the
sea in a river. Nor yet ended their unhappiness;
for ignorant that the speedy return of
the tide would set their ships afloat, they predicted
to themselves famine and death. Terrifying
monsters, too, left by the waves, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
gliding about at random.” Our little fleet did
not encounter such calamity and alarm as that
of Nearchus; for, in Q. Curtius’s words,&mdash;“by
a gradual diffusion, the inundation began
to raise the ships, presently flooding all the
fields, set the fleet in motion.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reflections.</div>

<p>I shall not now dwell on these subjects,
though eminently interesting; but, in the course
of my narrative, I shall endeavour to identify
the modern Indus with the features of remoter
times. If successful in the enquiry, we shall
add to our amusement, and the interest of the
chronicles themselves. It is difficult to describe
the enthusiasm one feels on first beholding the
scenes which have exercised the genius of Alexander.
That hero has reaped the immortality
which he so much desired, and transmitted the
history of his conquests, allied with his name, to
posterity. A town or a river, which lies on his
route, has acquired a celebrity that time serves
only to increase; and, while we gaze on the
Indus, we connect ourselves, at least in association,
with the ages of distant glory. Nor
can I pass over such feelings without observing,
that they are productive of the most solid advantages
to history and science. The Scamander
has an immortality which the vast Mississippi
itself can never eclipse, and the descent of the
Indus by Alexander of Macedon is, perhaps, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
most authentic and best attested event of profane
history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visited by
the Sinde
authorities.</div>

<p>The jealousy of the Sinde government had
been often experienced, and it was therefore
suggested that we should sail for the Indus,
without giving any previous information. Immediately
on anchoring, I despatched a communication
to the agent of the Ameers at Darajee,
signifying my plans; and, in the meanwhile,
ascended the river with caution, anchoring in
the fresh water on the second evening, thirty-five
miles from the sea. Near the mouth of
the river we passed a rock stretching across the
stream, which is particularly mentioned by Nearchus,
who calls it a “dangerous rock,” and is
the more remarkable, since there is not even
a stone below Tatta in any other part of the
Indus. We passed many villages, and had much
to enliven and excite our attention, had we not
purposely avoided all intercourse with the people
till made acquainted with the fate of our intimation
to the authorities at Darajee. A day
passed in anxious suspense; but, on the following
morning, a body of armed men crowded
round our boats, and the whole neighbourhood
was in a state of the greatest excitement. The
party stated themselves to be the soldiers of the
Ameer, sent to number our party, and see the
contents of all the boats, as well as every box<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
that they contained. I gave a ready and immediate
assent; and we were instantly boarded
by about fifty armed men, who wrenched open
every thing, and prosecuted the most rigorous
search for cannon and gunpowder. Mr. Leckie
and myself stood by in amazement, till it was at
length demanded that the box containing the
large carriage should be opened; for they pretended
to view it as the Greeks had looked on the
wooden horse, and believed that it would carry
destruction into Sinde. A sight of it disappointed
their hopes; and we must be conjurors,
it was asserted, to have come without arms and
ammunition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Retire to
the mouth
of the Indus.</div>

<p>When the search had been completed, I entered
into conversation with the head man of
the party, and had hoped to establish, by his
means, a friendly connection with the authorities;
but after a short pause, this personage, who was
a Reis of Lower Sinde, intimated, that a report
of the day’s transactions would be forthwith
transmitted to Hydrabad; and that, in the meanwhile,
it was incumbent on us to await the decision
of the Ameer, at the mouth of the river.
The request appeared reasonable; and the more
so, since the party agreed to furnish us with
every supply while so situated. We therefore
weighed anchor, and dropped down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
river; but here our civilities ended. By the
way we were met by several “dingies” full of
armed men, and at night were hailed by one of
them, to know how many troops we had on
board. We replied, that we had not even a
musket. “The evil is done,” rejoined a rude
Belooche soldier, “you have seen our country;
but we have four thousand men ready for action!”
To this vain-glorious observation succeeded
torrents of abuse; and when we reached
the mouth of the river, the party fired their
matchlocks over us; but I dropped anchor, and
resolved, if possible, to repel these insults by
personal remonstrance. It was useless; we were
surrounded by ignorant barbarians, who shouted
out in reply to all I said, that they had been ordered
to turn us out of the country. I protested
against their conduct in the most forcible language;
reminded them that I was the representative,
however humble, of a great Government,
charged with presents from Royalty; and added,
that, without a written document from their
master, I should decline quitting Sinde.

<span class="sidenote">Quit the
country.</span>
An
hour’s delay served to convince me that personal
violence would ensue, if I persisted in such
a resolution; and as it was not my object to
risk the success of the enterprise by such collision,
I sailed for the most eastern mouth of the
Indus, from which I addressed the authorities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
in Sinde, as well as Colonel Pottinger, the Resident
in Cutch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Communications
with
the Ameer.</div>

<p>I was willing to believe that the soldiers had
exceeded the authority which had been granted
them; and was speedily put in possession of a
letter from the Ameer, couched in friendly
terms, but narrating, at great length, the difficulty
and impossibility of navigating the Indus.
“The boats are so small,” said his Highness,
“that only four or five men can embark in one
of them; their progress is likewise slow; they
have neither masts not sails; and the depth of
water in the Indus is likewise so variable as
not to reach, in some places, the knee or waist
of a man.” But this formidable enumeration
of physical obstacles was coupled with no refusal
from the Ruler himself; and it seemed expedient,
therefore, to make a second attempt, after replying
to his Highness’s letter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return to
Sinde.</div>

<p>On the 10th of February we again set sail for
Sinde; but at midnight, on the 14th, were overtaken
by a fearful tempest, which scattered our
little fleet. Two of the vessels were dismasted;
we lost our small boat, split our sails, sprung
a leak; and, after being buffeted about for some
days by the fury of the winds and waves, succeeded
in getting an observation of the sun,
which enabled us to steer our course, and finally
conducted us in safety to Sinde. One of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
other four boats alone followed us. We now anchored
in the Pieteanee mouth of the Indus, and
I forthwith despatched the following document,
by a trustworthy messenger, to the agents at
Darajee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fruitless
negotiations.</div>

<p>1. “Let it be known to the Government agent
at Darajee, that this is the memorandum of
Mr. Burnes (sealed with his seal, and written
in the Persian language in his own handwriting),
the representative (vakeel) of the
English to the Ameer of Sinde, and likewise
the bearer of presents to Maharaja Runjeet
Sing from the King of England.</p>

<p>2. “I came to the Indus a few days ago; and
you searched my baggage, that you might report
the contents thereof to your master. I
have now returned, and await an answer.</p>

<p>3. “You may send any number of armed men
that you please; my life is in your power; but
remember that the Ameer will hold every one
responsible who molests me. Remember, too,
that I am a British officer, and have come
without a musket or a soldier (as you well
know); placing implicit reliance on the protection
of the ruler of Sinde, to whose care my
Government have committed me.</p>

<p>4. “I send this memorandum by two of my
own servants, and look to you for their being
protected.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<p>This remonstrance drew no reply from the
agent at Darajee; for the individual who had
held the situation on our first visit to Sinde, had
been dismissed for permitting us to ascend the
river; and our servants brought us notice that
we should not be permitted to land, nor to
receive either food or water. We observed,
therefore, the greatest possible economy in the
distribution of our provisions, and placed padlocks
on the tanks, in the hope of reason yet
guiding the councils of the Ameer. When our
supply of water failed, I despatched a small boat
up the river to procure some; but it was
seized, and the party detained; which now rendered
us hopeless of success, and only anxious
to quit the inhospitable shores of Sinde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imminent
danger on
the Indus.
Quit Sinde.</div>

<p>On the 22d of February we weighed our anchor,
at daylight; and when in the narrow mouth
of the river, the wind suddenly changed. The
tide, which ran with terrific violence, cast us on
the breakers of the bar; the sea rolled over us,
and we struck the ground at each succeeding
wave. In despair, the anchor was dropped; and
when we thought only of saving our lives, we
found our vessel had rubbed over the breakers
of the bank, and floated. I admired the zeal
and bravery of our crew; and was much struck
with their pious ejaculations to the tutelar saint
of Cutch, Shah Peer, when they found themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
beyond the reach of danger. “Oh! holy and
generous saint,” shouted the whole crew,
“you are truly good.” Frankincense was forthwith
burned to his honour; and a sum of money
was collected, and hallowed by its fragrance, as
the property of the saint. The amount subscribed
testified the sincerity of the poor men’s
gratitude; and if I believed not the efficacy of
the offering, I refused not, on that account, to
join, by their request, in the manifestations of
their duty and gratitude. Our other vessel, not
so fortunate as ourselves, was cast on shore,
though on a less dangerous bank. We rendered
her assistance, and sailed for Cutch, and anchored
in Mandivee roads after a surprising run
of thirty-three hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations
with
the Ameer.</div>

<p>It could not now be concealed that the conduct
of the Ameer of Sinde was most unfriendly;
but he yet betrayed no such feeling in his letters.
He magnified the difficulties of navigating the
Indus, and arrayed its rocks, quicksands, whirlpools,
and shallows, in every communication;
asserting that the voyage to Lahore had never
been performed in the memory of man. It was
evident that he viewed the expedition with the
utmost distrust and alarm; and the native agent,
who resides at Hydrabad on the part of the
British Government, described, not without some
degree of humour, the fear and dread of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
jealous potentate. In his estimation, we were
the precursors of an army; and did he now desire
to grant us a passage through Sinde, he was
at a loss to escape from the falsehoods and contradictions
which he had already stated in his
epistles. One letter went on to say, that “the
Ameer of Sinde avoids giving any reply, lest
he should be involved in perplexity; and he
has stopped his ears with the <i>cotton</i> of <i>absurdity</i>,
and taken some silly notions into his
head, that if Captain Burnes should now come,
he will see thousands of boats on the Indus,
and report the same to his Government, who
will conclude that it is the custom of the
Ameer of Sinde to deceive on all subjects,
and that he has no sort of friendship.” At
length, after a remonstrance from Colonel Pottinger,
both he and myself received letters
from Hydrabad, offering a road through Sinde
by land. As this might be fairly deemed the
first opening which had presented itself during
the whole negotiation, with the advice of Colonel
Pottinger I set out a third time for the Indus.
That officer in the meanwhile intimated my departure
to the Ameer, and pointed out the impossibility
of my proceeding by land to Lahore.
He also intimated, in no measured language,
that the vacillating and unfriendly conduct of
the Ameer of Sinde would not pass unnoticed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the more particularly, since it concerned the
passage of gifts, which had been sent by his most
gracious Majesty the King of Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Third
voyage to
the Indus.</div>

<p>On the 10th of March we once more set
sail for the Indus; and reached the Hujamree,
one of the central mouths of the river, after a
prosperous voyage of seven days. We could
hire no pilot to conduct us across the bar, and
took the wrong and shallow mouth of the river,
ploughing up the mud as we tacked in its narrow
channel. The foremost vessel loosened her red
ensign when she had fairly reached the deep
water; and, with the others, we soon and joyfully
anchored near her. We were now met by
an officer of the Sinde Government, one of the
favoured descendants of the Prophet, whose enormous
corpulence bespoke his condition. This
personage came to the mouth of the river; for
we were yet refused all admittance to the fresh
water. He produced a letter from the Ameer,
and repeated the same refuted arguments of his
master, which he seemed to think should receive
credit from his high rank. It would be tiresome
to follow the Sindians through the course of chicanery
which they adopted, even in this stage of
the proceedings. An embargo was laid on all
the vessels in the Indus; and we ourselves were
confined to our boats, on a dangerous shore, and
even denied fresh water. The officer urged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
propriety of our taking a route by land; and, as
a last resource, I offered to accompany him to the
capital, and converse with the Ameer in person,
having previously landed the horses.


<span class="sidenote">Land in
Sinde.</span>
I made
known this arrangement by a courier, which I
despatched to the Court; and on the following
morning quitted the boats, along with Syud
Jeendul Shah, who had been appointed our
Mihmandar.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> No sooner had we reached Tatta,
than the required sanction for the boats to ascend
by the Indus was received, provided we ourselves
took the land route; but I immediately
declined to advance another step without my
charge; and ultimately effected, by a week’s negotiation
at Tatta, the desired end. At the expense
of being somewhat tedious, I will give an
abstract of these proceedings as a specimen of
Sindian policy and reasoning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations
at
Tatta.</div>

<p>A few hours after reaching Tatta, Syud Zoolfkar
Shah, a man of rank, and engaging manners,
waited on us on the part of the Ameer. He
was accompanied by our Mihmandar, and met us
very politely. He said that he had been sent
by his Highness to escort us to Hydrabad; to
which I laconically replied, that nothing would
now induce me to go, since the Ameer had conceded
the request which I had made of him. The
Syud here marshalled all his eloquence; asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
me if I wished to ruin the Mihmandar, by making
him out a liar, after I had promised to accompany
him to the Court, and he had written so
to the Ameer; if I had no regard for a promise;
that the capital was close at hand, and I could
reach it in two marches; that, if I did not now
go, it could only be inferred that I had been
practising delusion, from a desire to see Tatta;
for I had even been allowed to choose the route
by that city, contrary to orders; and that I was
not, perhaps, aware of the high character of the
Syud, who was a descendant of the holy Prophet,
and honourable in this land; whose dignity,
the Christians, who preserved even the relic of
Jesus Christ’s nail, could well understand; and
that it was not the part of a wise man to cavil
like a moollah, since the Ameer had sanctioned
the advance of the mission by water, if we embarked
at Hydrabad, and would be answerable
for the safety of the horses to that place; and,
finally, that if I persisted in taking the route by
water, he was desired to say that it was a violation
of the treaty between the states.</p>

<p>I heard with attention the arguments of Zoolfkar
Shah; nor did I forget that the praises and
respect which he claimed for his friend, as a
descendant of the Prophet, likewise included
himself. I replied, that there had existed a
long standing friendship between Sinde and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
British Government; that I had been despatched
by a well frequented route, to deliver the presents
of our gracious Sovereign to Runjeet
Sing at Lahore; that, on reaching Sinde, I had
been insulted, abused, starved, and twice turned
out of the country by low persons, whom I
named; that my Government, which was ever
considerate, had attributed this unheard-of insolence,
not to their <i>friend</i>, the Ameer of Sinde,
but to the ignorance of mean individuals, and
had despatched me a third time to Sinde: when
I reached it, I found Syud Jeendul Shah ready
to receive me; but although thoroughly satisfied
that the presents of which I was in charge could
never be forwarded by land, he offered me that
route, and detained me on board ship for eleven
days, till necessity had driven me to make a proposal
of repairing in person to the presence of
the Ameer, in hopes of persuading that personage.
The case was now altered; the water
route had been granted, which rendered my
visit to Hydrabad unnecessary; and I could
only view the present procedure in the light of
jealousy, which it was unbecoming in a Government
to entertain. I continued, that I had
chosen the route by Tatta, because my bills were
payable at that city; and the sooner the Syud
got his master to meet my wishes, the better; for
the floods of the Indus were at hand, the hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
season approached, and delay would increase the
hazard; while no arguments but force would
now induce me to visit the Court, or permit the
horses to be moved without my presence. In
fine, if it were not the intention of the Ameer to
act a friendly part, he had only to say so, and
I would forthwith quit the country when I received
a letter to that effect; and finally, that he
had formed a very erroneous opinion of the British
character, if he considered that I had been sent
here in breach of a treaty, for I had come to
strengthen the bonds of union; and, what was
further, that the promise of an officer was sacred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Address the
Ameer.</div>



<p>An interview in the following morning, brought
a repetition of the whole arguments; and as we
could not convince each other, we both agreed
to address his Highness. After the style of
Asiatic diplomacy, I informed the Ameer, “that
he had acted the part of a friend, in first pointing
out the difficulties of navigating the Indus,
and now assisting me through them by giving
his sanction to the water route; but since I
was so thoroughly acquainted, through his
Highness’s kindness, with the dangers of the
river, I dared not trust such royal rarities, as the
gifts of the King of Great Britain, to the care
of any servant.”
<span class="sidenote">Success.</span>
In three days I received a
full and unqualified sanction to advance by water
from the mouth of the Indus. I gladly quit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
detail of occurrences which have left few pleasing
reflections behind, except that success ultimately
attended our endeavours, and that they elicited
the approbation of Government. The Ameer of
Sinde had sought to keep us in ignorance of the
Indus; but his treatment had led to another
and opposite effect; since we had entered, in the
course of out several voyages, <i>all</i> the mouths of
the river, and a map of them, as well as of the
land route to Tatta, now lay before me. Our
dangers on the banks and shoals had been imminent;
but we looked back upon them with the
pleasing thought, that our experience might
guide others through them.</p>

TATTA TO HYDRABAD.</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Tatta.</div>

<p>A week’s stay was agreeably spent in examining
Tatta and the objects of curiosity which surround
it. The city stands at a distance of three miles
from the Indus. It is celebrated in the history
of the East. Its commercial prosperity passed
away with the empire of Delhi, and its ruin has
been completed since it fell under the iron
despotism of the present rulers of Sinde. It
does not contain a population of 15,000 souls;
and of the houses scattered about its ruins,
one half are destitute of inhabitants. It is
said, that the dissentions between the last and
present dynasties, which led to Sinde being overrun
by the Afghans, terrified the merchants of
the city, who fled the country at that time, and
have had no encouragement to return. Of the
weavers of “loongees” (a kind of silk and cotton
manufacture), for which this place was once so
famous, but 125 families remain. There are not
forty merchants<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in the city. Twenty money-changers
transact all the business of Tatta; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
its limited population is now supplied with
animal food by five butchers. Such has been
the gradual decay of that mighty city, so populous
in the early part of last century, in the days
of Nadir Shah. The country in its vicinity lies
neglected, and but a small portion of it is
brought under tillage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its antiquity.</div>

<p>The antiquity of Tatta is unquestioned. The
Pattala of the Greeks has been sought for in its
position, and, I believe, with good reason; for
the Indus here divides into two great branches;
and these are the words of the historian:&mdash;“Near
Pattala, the river Indus divides itself
into two vast branches.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Both Robertson
and Vincent appear to have entertained the
opinion of its identity with Tatta. The Hindoo
Rajas named it Sameenuggur, before the Mahommedan
invasion; which I believe to be the
Minagur of the Periplus. There is a ruined city,
called Kullancote, to be yet seen, four miles S.W.
of Tatta. It was also named Brahminabad, and
ruled by one brother, while another held Hydrabad,
then called Nerancote; the Arabs called
it Dewul Sindy. Nuggur Tatta (by which it is
now familiarly known) is a more modern name.
Till the Talpoors secured their present footing
in Sinde, it was always the capital of the country.
It is an open town, built on a rising ground in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
low valley. In several wells I found bricks imbedded
in earth, at a depth of twenty feet from
the surface; but there are no remains of a
prior date to the tombs, on a remarkable ridge
westward of the town, which are about 200 years
old. The houses are formed of wood and wicker-work,
plastered over with earth; they are lofty,
with flat roofs, but very confined, and resemble
square towers; their colour, which is of a greyish
murky hue, gives an appearance of solidity to
the frail materials of which they are constructed.
Some of the better sort have a base of brickwork;
but stone has only been used in the
foundations of one or two mosques, though it
may be had in abundance. There is little in
modern Tatta to remind one of its former greatness.
A spacious brick mosque, built by Shah
Jehan, still remains, but is crumbling to decay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hinglaj,
a famous
pilgrimage.</div>

<p>Tatta stands on the high road from India to
Hinglaj, in Mekran, a place of pilgrimage and
great celebrity, situated under the barren mountains
of Hala (the Irus of the ancients), and
marked only by a spring of fresh water, without
house or temple. The spot is believed to have
been visited by Ramchunder, the Hindoo demi-god,
himself; an event which is chronicled on
the rock, with figures of the sun and moon
engraven as further testimony! The distance
from Tatta exceeds 200 miles; and the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
passes by Curachee, Soumeeanee, and the province
of Lus, the country of the Noomrees, a
portion of the route of Alexander the Great. A
journey to Hinglaj purifies the pilgrim from his
sins; a cocoa-nut, cast into a cistern, exhibits
the nature of his career: if the water bubbles
up, his life has been, and will continue, pure; but
if still and silent, the Hindoo must undergo
further penance, to appease the deity. The
tribe of Goseins, who are a kind of religious
mendicants, though frequently merchants and
most wealthy, frequent this sequestered place,
and often extend their journey to an island called
Seetadeep, not far from Bunder Abbass, in Persia.
They travel in caravans of an hundred, or even
more, under an “agwa,” or spiritual guide. At
Tatta they are furnished by the high-priest with
a rod, which is supposed to partake of his own
virtues, and to conduct the <i>cortège</i> to its destination.
In exchange for its talismanic powers, each
pilgrim pays three rupees and a half, and faithfully
promises to restore the rod on his return; for no
one dares to reside in so holy and solitary a spot.
The “agwa” receives with it his reward; and
many a Hindoo expends in this pilgrimage the
hard-earned wealth of a whole life. On his
arrival at Tatta from Hinglaj, he is invested
with a string of white beads, peculiar to that
city, and only found on the rocky ridge near it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>.
They resemble the grains of pulse or juwaree;
and the pilgrim has the satisfaction of believing
that they are the petrified grain of the Creator,
left on earth to remind him of his creation.
They now form a monopoly and source of profit
to the priests of Tatta.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Climate.
Return to
the mouth
of the Indus.</div>

<p>We quitted Tatta on the morning of the 10th
of April, and retraced our steps to Meerpoor; a
distance of twenty-four miles, over roads nearly
impassable from rain. I observe, in Hamilton’s
“India,” that there is frequently a dearth of it
here for three years at a time; but we had very
heavy showers and a severe fall of hail, though
the thermometer stood at 86°. The dews and
mists about Tatta make it a disagreeable residence
at this season; and the dust is described
as intolerable in June and July.</p>

<p>Our road lay through a desert country along
the “Buggaur;” one of the two large branches
of the Indus, which separate below Tatta. It
has its name from the destructive velocity with
which it runs, tearing up trees in its course. It has
been forsaken for a few years past, and had only
a width of 200 yards where we crossed it, below
Meerpoor. The Indus itself, before this division
takes place, is a noble river; and we beheld it at
Tatta with high gratification. The water is foul
and muddy; but it is 2000 feet wide, two fathoms
and a half deep, from shore to shore. When I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
first saw it, the surface was agitated by a violent
wind, which had raised up waves, that raged
with great fury; and I no longer felt wonder at
the natives designating so vast a river by the
name of “durya,” or the Sea of Sinde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Notions of
the people.</div>

<p>On our return, we saw much of the people,
who were disposed from the first to treat us more
kindly than the government. Their notions
regarding us were strange: some asked us why
we allowed dogs to clean our hands after a meal,
and if we indiscriminately ate cats and mice, as
well as pigs. They complained much of their
rulers, and the ruinous and oppressive system of
taxation to which they were subjected, as it
deterred them from cultivating any considerable
portion of land. Immense tracts of the richest soil
lie in a state of nature, between Tatta and the
sea, overgrown with tamarisk shrubs, which
attain, in some places, the height of twenty feet,
and, threading into one another, form impervious
thickets. At other places, we passed extensive
plains of hard-caked clay, with remains of ditches
and aqueducts, now neglected. We reached the
sea in two days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alexander’s
journey.</div>

<p>Arrian informs us, that, after Alexander returned
from viewing the right branch of the
Indus, he again set out from Pattala, and descended
the other branch of the river, which
conducted him to a “certain lake, joined either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
by the river spreading wide over a flat country,
or by additional streams flowing into it from
the adjacent parts, and making it appear like a
bay in the sea.” There, too, he commanded
another haven to be built, named Xylenopolis.
The professed object of this second voyage to
the sea was to seek for bays and creeks on the
sea-coast, and to explore which of the two
branches would afford the greatest facilities for
the passage of his fleet; for Arrian says, “he
had a vast ambition of sailing all through the
sea, from India to Persia, to prove that the
Indian Gulf had a communication with the
Persian.” In this bay Alexander landed, with
a party of horse, and travelled along the coast,
to try if he could find bays and creeks to
secure his fleets from storms; “<i>causing wells to
be dug, to supply his navy with water</i>.” I
look upon it, therefore, as conclusive that Alexander
the Great descended by the Buggaur and
Sata, the two great branches below Tatta, and
never entered Cutch, as has been surmised, but
that his three days’ journey, after descending the
eastern branch, was westward, and between the
two mouths, in the direction his fleet was to sail.</p>

<p>On the 12th of April, we embarked in the
flat-bottomed boats, or “doondees,” of Sinde,
and commenced our voyage on the Indus, with
no small degree of satisfaction. Our fleet con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>sisted
of six of these flat-bottomed vessels,
and a small English-built pinnace, which we had
brought from Cutch. The boats of the Indus
are not unlike China junks, very capacious, but
most unwieldy. They are floating houses; and
with ourselves we transported the boatmen, their
wives and families, kids and fowls. When there
is no wind, they are pulled up against the stream,
by ropes attached to the mast-head, at the rate of
a mile and a half an hour; but with a breeze,
they set a large square-sail, and advance double
the distance. We halted at Vikkur, which is
the first port; a place of considerable export for
grain, that had then fifty “doondees,” besides
sea-vessels, lying near it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wanyanee
branch.</div>

<p>On the 13th, we threaded many small creeks
for a distance of eight miles, and then entered
the Wanyanee, or principal branch of the Indus,
which is a fine river, 500 yards broad and 24 feet
deep. Its banks were alternately steep and flat,
the course very crooked, and the different turnings
were often marked by branches running
from this trunk to other arms of the delta. We
had nothing but tamarisk on either bank, and
the reed huts of a few fishermen, alone indicated
that we were in a peopled country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A holy
man.</div>

<p>As we ascended the river, the inhabitants
came for miles around to see us. A Syud stood
on the water’s edge, and gazed with astonish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>ment.
He turned to his companion as we
passed, and, in the hearing of one of our party,
said, “Alas! Sinde is now gone, since the English
have seen the river, which is the road to
its conquest.” If such an event do happen, I
am certain that the body of the people will hail
the happy day; but it will be an evil one for the
Syuds, the descendants of Mahommed, who are
the only people, besides the rulers, that derive
precedence and profit from the existing order of
things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strictness
of religious
observances.</div>

<p>Nothing more arrests the notice of a stranger,
on entering Sinde, than the severe attention of
the people to the forms of religion, as enjoined
by the Prophet of Arabia. In all places, the
meanest and poorest of mankind may be seen, at
the appointed hours, turned towards Mecca,
offering up their prayers. I have observed a
boatman quit the laborious duty of dragging the
vessel against the stream, and retire to the shore,
wet and covered with mud, to perform his genuflexions.
In the smallest villages, the sound of
the “mowuzzun,” or crier, summoning true believers
to prayers, may be heard, and the Mahommedans
within reach of the sonorous sound
suspend, for the moment, their employment, that
they may add their “Amen” to the solemn sentence
when concluded. The effect is pleasing
and impressive; but, as has often happened in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
other countries at a like stage of civilisation, the
moral qualities of the people do not keep pace
with this fervency of devotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Navigation
of the Indus.</div>

<p>On the evening of the 15th, we anchored at
Tatta, after a prosperous voyage, that afforded a
good insight into the navigation of the Indus;
which, in the Delta, is both dangerous and difficult.
The water runs with impetuosity from
one bank to another, and undermines them so,
that they often fall in masses which would crush
a vessel. During night they may be heard
tumbling with a terrific crash and a noise as loud
as artillery. In one place, the sweep of the river
was so sudden that it had formed a kind of
whirlpool, and all our vessels heeled round, on
passing it, from the rapidity of the current. We
had every where six fathoms of water, and in
these eddies the depth was sometimes threefold;
but our vessels avoided the strength of the current,
and shifted from side to side, to choose the
shallows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pulla fish.</div>

<p>We ascended the Indus in the season of the
“pulla,” a fish of the carp species, as large as
the mackerel, and fully equalling the flavour of
salmon. It is only found in the four months
that precede the swell of the river from January
to April, and never higher than the fortress of
Bukkur. The natives superstitiously believe the
fish to proceed there on account of Khaju<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Khizr, a saint of celebrity, who is interred there,
from whence they are said to return without ever
turning their tails on the sanctified spot,&mdash;an
assertion which the muddy colour of the Indus
will prevent being contradicted. The mode of
catching this fish is ingenious, and peculiar, I
believe, to the Indus. Each fisherman is provided
with a large earthen jar, open at the top,
and somewhat flat. On this he places himself,
and, lying on it horizontally, launches into
the stream, swimming or pushing forward like
a frog, and guiding himself with his hands.
When he has reached the middle of the river,
where the current is strongest, he darts his net
directly under him, and sails down with the
stream. The net consists of a pouch attached
to a pole, which he shuts on meeting his game;
he then draws it up, spears it, and, putting it
into the vessel on which he floats, prosecutes
his occupation. There are some vessels of small
dimensions, without any orifice, and on these
the fishermen sail down, in a sitting posture.
Hundreds of people, old and young, may be
seen engaged in catching pulla, and the season
is hailed with joy by the people, as furnishing
a wholesome food while it lasts, and an
abundant supply of dry fish for the remaining
part of the year, as well as for exportation to
the neighbouring countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reach the
capital.</div>

<p>On the morning of the 18th, we moored opposite
Hydrabad, which is five miles inland,
having had a strong and favourable breeze from
Tatta, that brought us against the stream, at the
rate of three miles an hour. The dust was intolerable
every where, and a village might always
be discovered by the dense clouds which hovered
over it. This part of Sinde is well
known: the country is devoted to sterility by
the Ameers, to feed their passion for the chase.
The banks are enclosed to the water’s edge,
and the interior of these hunting-thickets is
overgrown with furze, brushwood, and stunted
babool trees, which always retain a verdant
hue, from the richness of the soil. One or
two solitary camels were to be seen raising
water to fill the pools of these preserves, as the
Ameer and his relatives had announced a hunting
excursion, and the deer<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> would be drawn by
thirst to drink at the only fountain, and shot by
an Ameer from a place of concealment. It is
thus that the chiefs sport with their game and
their subjects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deputation
from the
Ameer.</div>

<p>Immediately on our arrival, four different deputations
waited on us, to convey the congratulations
of Meer Moorad Ali Khan, and his
family, at our having reached the capital of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Sinde, and at the same time to tender the
strongest professions of friendship and respect
for the British government; to all of which I
returned suitable answers. In the evening we
were conducted to Hydrabad, and alighted at
the house, or “tanda,” of Nawab Wulee Mahommed
Khan, the Vizier of Sinde, whose son,
in the father’s absence, was appointed our mihmandar.
Tents were pitched, and provisions of
every description sent to us; and it would, indeed,
have been difficult to discover that we
were the individuals who had so long lingered
about the shores of Sinde, now the honoured
guests of its jealous master. Great and small
were in attendance on us: khans and Syuds,
servants and chobdars brought messages and
enquiries, till the night was far spent; and it
may not be amiss to mention, as a specimen of
conducting business in Sinde, that the barber,
the water-cooler, and the prime minister were
sent indiscriminately with errands on the same
subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations
for
reception at
court.</div>

<p>The ceremonial of our reception was soon
adjusted, but not without some exhibition of
Sindian character. After the time had been
mutually fixed for the following afternoon, our
mihmandar made his appearance at <i>daybreak</i>, to
request that we would then accompany him to the
palace. I spoke of the arrangements that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
been made; but he treated all explanation with
indifference, and eulogised, in extravagant language,
the great condescension of his master in
giving us an interview so early, while the Vakeels,
or representatives of other states, often waited
for weeks. I informed the Khan that I entertained
very different sentiments regarding his
master’s giving us so early a reception, and assured
him that I viewed it as no sort of favour,
and was satisfied that the Ameer himself was
proud in receiving, at any time, any agent of
the British Government. The reply silenced
him, and he shortly afterwards withdrew, and
sent an apology for this importunity, which, he
stated, had originated in a mistake. The pride
of the Sindian must be met by the same weapons;
and, however disagreeable the line of
conduct, it will be found, in all matters of negotiation,
to carry along with it its own reward:
altercations that have passed will be succeeded
by civility and politeness, and a shade of oblivion
will be cast over all that is unpleasant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Presentation.</div>

<p>In the evening we were presented to the
Ameer of Sinde by his son, Nusseer Khan, who
had previously received us in his own apartments,
to inform us of his attachment to the
British Government, and the state secret of his
having been the means of procuring for us a
passage through Sinde. We found the Ameer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
seated in the middle of a room, attended by his
various relatives: they all rose on our entrance,
and were studiously polite. His Highness addressed
me by name; said I was his friend, both
on public and private grounds; for my brother
(Dr. Burnes) had cured him of a dangerous disease.
At the same time he caused me to be
seated along with him on the cushion which he
occupied: he begged that I would forget the difficulties
and dangers encountered, and consider
him as the ally of the British Government, and
my own friend. The long detention which
had occurred in our advance, he continued,
had arisen from his ignorance of political concerns,
as he considered it involved a breach of
the treaty between the states; for he was a
soldier, and knew little of such matters, and
was employed in commanding <i>the three hundred
thousand Beloochees</i>, over whom God had appointed
him to rule! We had now, however,
arrived at his capital, and he assured us that
we were welcome: his own state barge should
convey us to his frontier; his subjects should
drag our vessels against the stream. Elephants
and palanqueens were at our disposal, if we
would accept them; and he would vie in exertion
with ourselves, to forward, in safety, the
presents of his Most Gracious Majesty the King
of Great Britain, and had nominated the son of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
his Vizier to accompany us to the limits of
his territories. I did not deem it necessary to
enter into any explanation with his Highness,
nor to give him in return the muster-roll of
our mighty army. I thanked him for his marks
of attention to the Government and ourselves,
and said, that I was glad to find that the
friendship between the states, which had led
to my taking the route through his dominions,
had not been underrated; for it would be worse
than folly in an unprotected individual to attempt
a passage by the Indus without his cordial
concurrence. With regard to the dangers and
difficulties which had been already encountered,
I assured his Highness, that the prevailing good
fortune of the British Government had predominated;
and though it was not in the power
of man to avert calamities by sea, we had by
the favour of God happily escaped them all,
and I doubted not that the authorities I served
would derive as much satisfaction from the manner
in which he had now received us as I
myself did. The interview here terminated;
his Highness previously fixing the following
morning for a second meeting, when I would
communicate some matters of a political nature
with which I had been charged by the Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Court of
Sinde.</div>

<p>I shall not enter on a description of the Court<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of Sinde, as it may be found in Lieut. Col. Pottinger’s
work, and in a narrative lately published
by my brother.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Its splendour must have faded,
for though the Ameer and his family certainly
wore some superb jewels, there was not much
to attract our notice in their palace or durbar:
they met in a dirty hall without a carpet; they
sat in a room which was filled by a rabble of
greasy soldiery, and the noise and dust were
hardly to be endured. The orders of the Ameer
himself to procure silence, though repeated
several times, were ineffectual, and some of
the conversation was inaudible on that account.
We were, however, informed that the crowd
had been collected to display the legions of
Sinde; and they certainly contrived to fill the
alleys and passages every where, not could we
pass out of the fort without some exertion on
the part of the nobles, who were our conductors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Presents.</div>

<p>I followed up the interview by sending the
government presents which I had brought for
his Highness: they consisted of various articles
of European manufacture,&mdash;a gun, a brace of
pistols, a gold watch, two telescopes, a clock,
some English shawls and cloths, with two pair
of elegant cut glass candlesticks and shades.
Some Persian works beautifully lithographed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Bombay, and a map of the World and Hindoostan,
in Persian characters, completed the gift.
The principal Ameer had previously sent two
messages, begging that I would not give the
articles to any person but himself; and the possessor
of fifteen millions sterling portioned, with
a partial hand, among the members of his family,
the gifts that did not exceed the value of a few
hundred pounds.


<span class="sidenote">Sindian
meanness.</span>
His meanness may be imagined,
when he privately deputed his Vizier to beg
that I would exchange the clock and candlesticks
for some articles among the presents, which
I doubtless had for other chiefs, as they formed
no part of the furniture of a Sindian palace. I
told the Vizier that the presents which I had
brought were intended to display the manufactures
of Europe, and it was not customary to
give the property of one person to another.
This denial produced a second message; and,
as a similar occurrence happened, in 1809, to a
mission at this court, we gather from the coincidence
how little spirit and feeling actuate the
cabinet of Hydrabad. Some score of trays,
loaded with fruit and sweetmeats adorned with
gold-leaf, and sent by the different members of
the family, closed the day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parting interview.</div>

<p>Early in the morning, we were conducted to
the durbar by Meer Ismaeel Shah, one of the
Viziers, and our mihmandar: on the road the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Vizier took occasion to assure me how much I
would please the Ameer by changing the clock!
There was more order and regularity in our
second interview, which was altogether very
satisfactory; for the Ameer gave a ready assent
to the wishes of Government when they
were communicated to him. The conversation
which ensued was of the most friendly description.
His Highness asked particularly for
my brother, looked attentively at our dress, and
was much amused with the shape and feather of
the cocked hat I wore. Before bidding him
adieu, he repeated, in even stronger language, all
his yesterday’s professions; and, however questionable
his sincerity, I took my departure with
much satisfaction at what had passed, since it
seemed he would no longer interrupt our advance
to Lahore. Meer Nusseer Khan, the son
of the Ameer, presented me with a handsome
Damascus sword, which had a scabbard of red
velvet ornamented with gold; his father sent
me a purse of fifteen hundred rupees, with an
apology, that he had not a blade mounted as he
desired, and begged I would accept the value of
one. After all the inconvenience to which we
had been subjected, we hardly expected such a
reception at Hydrabad. Next morning we left
the city, and encamped on the banks of the
Indus near our boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Scenery
near Hydrabad.</div>

<p>The scenery near the capital of Sinde is varied
and beautiful: the sides of the river are lined
with lofty trees; and there is a background of
hill to relieve the eye from the monotony which
presents itself in the dusty arid plains of the
Delta. The Indus is larger, too, than in most
places lower down, being about 830 yards wide;
there is a sand-bank in the middle, but it is hidden
by the stream. The island on which Hydrabad
stands is barren, from the rocky and hilly
nature of the soil, but even the arable parts are
poorly cultivated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hydrabad.</div>

<p>On the capital itself, I can add little to the
accounts which are already on record. It does
not contain a population of twenty thousand
souls, who live in houses, or rather huts, built of
mud. The residence of the chief himself is a
comfortless miserable dwelling. The fort, as
well as the town, stands on a rocky hillock; and
the former is a mere shell, partly surrounded by
a ditch, about ten feet wide and eight deep, over
which there is a wooden bridge. The walls are
about twenty-five feet high, built of brick, and
fast going to decay. Hydrabad is a place of no
strength, and might readily be captured by
escalade. In the centre of the fort there is a
massive tower, unconnected with the works,
which overlooks the surrounding country. Here
are deposited a great portion of the riches of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Sinde. The Fulailee river insulates the ground
on which Hydrabad stands; but, though a
considerable stream during the swell, it was
quite dry when we visited this city in April.
The view of Hydrabad, prefixed to this volume,
and for which I am indebted to Captain M.
Grindlay, faithfully represents that capital and
the country which surrounds it.</p>

<span class="smaller">VOYAGE TO BUKKUR.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">Departure
from Hydrabad.</div>

<p>On the morning of the 23d of April, we
embarked in the state barge of the Ameer,
which is called a “jumtee” by the natives of the
country. They are very commodious vessels,
of the same build as the other flat-bottomed
boats of the Indus, and sadly gainsayed the
beggarly account which his Highness had, in his
correspondence, so often given of the craft in
the river. It was about sixty feet long, and had
three masts, on which we hoisted as many sails,
made of alternate stripes of red and white cloth.
There were two cabins, connected with each
other by a deck; but, contrary to the custom
in other countries, the one at the bows is the
post of honour. It was of a pavilion shape,
covered with scarlet cloth, and the eyes of
intruders were excluded on all sides by silken
screens. The jumtee was further decorated by
variegated flags and pendants, some of which
were forty feet long. We hoisted the British
ensign at the stern of our pinnace, the first time,
I suppose, it had ever been unfurled on the
Indus; and the little vessel which bore it out-sailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
all the fleet. I hope the omen was
auspicious, and that the commerce of Britain
may soon follow her flag. We moved merrily
through the water, generally with a fair wind,
anchoring always at night, and pitching our
camp on the shore, pleased to find ourselves
beyond the portals of Hydrabad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sehwun.</div>

<p>We reached Sehwun on the 1st of May, a
distance of 100 miles, in eight days. There
was little to interest us on the banks of the
river, which are thinly peopled, and destitute of
trees or variety to diversify the scene. The
Lukkee mountains, a high range, came in sight
on the third day, running in upon the Indus at
Sehwun. The stream itself, though grand and
magnificent, was often divided by sand-banks,
and moved sluggishly along at the rate of two
miles and a half an hour. One of our boats had
nearly sunk from coming in contact with a protruding
stump; an accident of frequent occurrence
on the Indus, as well as on the American
rivers, and sometimes attended with fatal results,
particularly to vessels descending the
stream. Our escape from calamity gave the
Sindians a topic for congratulation, and we
daily heard the greatness of our fortune proclaimed.
Every trivial incident, a slight breeze
or any such occurrence, they did not hesitate to
ascribe to our destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Crew of the
boat.</div>

<p>Our crew consisted of sixteen men; and a
happy set of beings they were: they waded
through the water all day, and swam and sported
about, as they passed along, with joyous hearts,
returning occasionally to the boat to indulge in
the hooka, and the intoxicating “bang,” or
hemp, to which they are much addicted. They
prepare this drug by straining the juice from the
seeds and stalks through a cloth: when ready
for use, it resembles green putrid water. It
must be very pernicious. I do not know if I
can class their pipes among the movables of the
ship; for their stands were formed of a huge
piece of earthenware, too heavy to be lifted,
which remains at the stern, where the individuals
retire to inhale the weed, made doubly
noxious by its being mixed with opium. The
sailors of Sinde are Mahommedans. They are
very superstitious, the sight of a crocodile below
Hydrabad is an evil omen which would never
be forgotten; and in that part of the Indus
these monsters certainly confined themselves to
the deep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Sindian
song.</div>

<p>In the songs and chorus which the Sindians
use in pulling their ropes and sails, we discover
their reverence for saints. Seafaring people
are, I believe, musical in all countries; and,
though in a strange dialect, there is simplicity
and beauty in some of the following <span class="lock">rhymes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As we discovered the mosques of Sehwun, the
boatmen in their joy beat a drum, and chanted
many of these verses, which had a pleasing
sound on passing the base of the Lukkee mountains,
that present a rocky buttress to the Indus
on approaching Sehwun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sehwun,
its antiquity.</div>

<p>The town of Sehwun stands on a rising
ground, at the verge of a swamp, two miles
from the Indus, close to a branch of that river
called Arul, which flows from Larkhanu. It
has a population of about 10,000 souls, and is
commanded on the north side by a singular
castle or mound of earth. Sehwun is sometimes
called Sewistan, and is a place of antiquity.
There are many ruined mosques and tombs
which surround it, and proclaim its former
wealth; but it has gradually gone to decay
since it ceased to be the residence of a governor,
who here held his court in the days of Moghul
splendour. As it stands near the Lukkee mountains,
I believe it may be fixed on as the city of
Sambus, Raja of the Indian mountaineers, mentioned
by Alexander. The Sindomanni cannot
refer to the inhabitants of Lower Sinde, which
is always called Pattala, and its ruler the “prince
of the Pattalans.” Sindee is the modern term
for the aboriginal inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pilgrimage
of Sehwun.</div>

<p>Sehwun has considerable celebrity and sanctity
from the tomb of a holy saint of Khorasan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
by name Lal Shah Baz, who was interred
here about 600 years ago. The shrine stands
in the centre of the town, and rests under
a lofty dome at one end of a quadrangular
building, which is handsomely ornamented by
blue painted slabs, like Dutch tiles, that give it
a rich appearance. A cloth of gold, with two
other successive palls of red silk, are suspended
over the sepulchre, and on the walls which surround
it are inscribed in large Arabic letters
the praises of the deceased, and extracts from
the Koran. Ostrich eggs, peacocks’ feathers,
beads, flowers, &amp;c. complete the furniture of this
holy spot; and pigeons, the emblems of peace,
are encouraged to perch on the cloths which
shade the remains of departed virtue. The
miracles of Lal Shah Baz are endless, if you
believe the people. The Indus is subject to his
commands, and no vessel dares to pass his shrine
without making a propitiatory offering at his
tomb. Thousands of pilgrims flock to the consecrated
spot, and the monarchs of Cabool and
India have often visited the sanctuary. The
drums which proclaim the majesty of the saint
are a gift from the renowned persecutor Alla-o-deen,
who reigned <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1242; and the gate,
which is of silver, attests the homage and devotion
of a deceased Ameer of Sinde. The
needy are daily supplied with food from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
charity of the stranger; but the universal bounty
has corrupted the manners of the inhabitants,
who are a worthless and indolent set of men.
The Hindoo joins with the Mahommedan in his
veneration of the saint, and artfully insinuates
“Lal” to be a Hindoo name, and that the
Mahommedans have associated with the faith
of their prophet the god of an infidel creed. A
tiger, once the tenant of the neighbouring hills,
partakes of the general bounty in a cage near
the tomb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Castle of
Sehwun,
its antiquity.</div>

<p>By far the most singular building at Sehwun,
and perhaps on the Indus, is the ruined
castle which overlooks the town, and is in all
probability as old as the age of the Greeks. It
consists of a mound of earth sixty feet high,
and surrounded from the very ground by a brick
wall. The shape of the castle is oval, about
1200 feet long by 750 in diameter. The interior
presents a heap of ruins, and is strewed with
broken pieces of pottery and brick. The gateway
is on the town side, and has been arched:
a section through it proves the whole mound
to be artificial. At a distance this castle resembles
the drawings of the Mujilebe tower at
Babylon, described by Mr. Rich in his interesting
Memoir.</p>

<p>The natives afford no satisfactory account of
this ruin, attributing it to the age of Budur-ool-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Jamal,
a fairy, whose agency is referred to in
every thing ancient or wonderful in Sinde. It
is to be observed, that the Arul river passes close
to this castle; and we are informed by Quintus
Curtius that, in the territories of Sabus Raja,
(which I imagine refers to Sehwun,) “Alexander
took the strongest city by a tunnel formed by
his miners.” A ruin of such magnitude,
standing, as it therefore does, on such a site,
would authorise our fixing on it as the very city
“where the barbarians, untaught in engineering,
were confounded when their enemies
appeared, almost in the middle of the city,
rising from a subterraneous passage of which
no trace was previously seen.” So strong a
position would not, in all probability, be neglected
in after-times; and in the reign of the
Emperor Humaioon, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1541, we find that
monarch unable to capture Sehwun, from which
he fled on his disastrous journey to Omercote.
His son Acbar also invested Sehwun for seven
months, and after its capture seems to have
dismantled it. There are many coins found in
the castle of Sehwun; but among thirty I could
find no trace of the Greek alphabet. They were
Mahommedan coins of the sovereigns of Delhi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mound of
Amree.</div>

<p>About eighteen miles below Sehwun, and on
the same side of the river, is the village of
Amree, believed to have been once a large city,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and the favourite residence of former kings.
It is said to have been swept into the Indus.
Near the modern village, however, there is a
mound of earth, about forty feet high, which
the traditions of the country point out as the
halting-place of a king, who ordered the dung
of his cavalry to be gathered together, and
hence the mound of Amree! There are some
tombs near it, but they are evidently modern.</p>

<p>We halted four days at Sehwun. The climate
was most sultry and oppressive: the thermometer
stood at 112°, and did not fall below 100°
at midnight, owing to scorching winds from the
west, where the country is bleak and mountainous.
The lofty range which runs parallel
with the Indus from the sea-coast to the centre
of Asia, is joined by the Lukkee mountains
south of Sehwun, and thus excludes the refreshing
breezes of the ocean.</p>

<p>We quitted Sehwun on the 4th with difficulty,
for we could not procure men to drag
our boats. The mihmandar, though he was
the vizier’s son, and acted under the seal of
the Ameer, could not prevail on the Calendar,
or priest of the tomb, who said that no such
order had been ever given, and he would not
now obey it. Some persons were seized: his
people drew their swords, and said that, when
no longer able to wield them, they might go.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
We knew nothing of the matter till it was over,
as it was entirely a private arrangement of Syud
Tukkee Shah, the mihmandar. When the men
heard they were to be remunerated for their
trouble, they came of their own accord before
we sailed. Every thing in Sinde being effected
by force under despotism, the watermen of
Sehwun fled the town, or took up their abode
in the sanctuary, when they saw the “jumtee”
approach, believing, as usual, that services would
be required of them gratuitously.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Congratulations
from
Khyrpoor.</div>

<p>On the day after quitting Sehwun, we were
met by Mahommed Gohur, a Belooche chief,
and a party, the confidential agents of Meer
Roostum Khan, the Ameer of Khyrpoor, who
had been sent to the frontier, a distance of
eighty miles, to congratulate us on our arrival,
and declare their master’s devotion to the British
Government. We hardly expected such a mark
of attention in Sinde, and were therefore gratified.
The deputation brought an abundant
supply of sheep, flour, fruit, spices, sugar, butter,
ghee, tobacco, opium, &amp;c. &amp;c., on which our
people feasted. Sheep were slain and cooked;
rice and ghee were soon converted into savoury
viands; and I believe all parties thanked Meer
Roostum Khan as heartily as we did, nor did I
imagine that this was but the commencement of
a round of feasting which was daily repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
so long as we were in his country, a period of
three weeks. Mahommed Gohur was a decrepit
old man, with a red beard. He wore a very
handsome loongee round his waist. He did not
recover from his surprise throughout the interview,
for he had never before seen an European.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Address the
Ameer of
Khyrpoor.</div>

<p>In return for Meer Roostum Khan’s kindness,
I addressed to him a Persian letter in the following
terms, which will serve as a specimen of the
epistolary style used by the people of this country,
which I imitated as closely as possible.:&mdash;</p>

<p>(After compliments:) “I hasten to inform your
Highness that I have reached the frontiers of
your country in company with the respectable
Syud Tukkee Shah, who has accompanied me
on the part of Meer Morad Ali Khan from
Hydrabad. As I have long since heard of
your Highness from those who pass between
Cutch and Sinde, it forms a source of congratulation
to me that I have arrived in your
dominions, and brought along with me in
safety the presents which have been graciously
bestowed on Maha Raja Runjeet Sing by His
Majesty the King of England, mighty in rank,
terrible as the planet Mars, a monarch great
and magnificent, of the rank of Jemshid, of
the dignity of Alexander, unequalled by Darius,
just as Nousherwan, great as Fureedoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
admired as Cyrus, famed as the Sun, the destroyer
of tyranny and oppression, upright
and generous, pious and devout, favoured
from above, &amp;c. &amp;c.: may his dominion endure
for ever!</p>

<p>“It is well known that when a friend comes
to the country of a friend it is a source of
much happiness, and I have therefore written
these few lines; but when I have the pleasure
of seeing you, my joy will be increased.</p>

<p>“I had written thus far, when the respectable
Mahommed Gohur, one of those enjoying your
Highness’s confidence, arrived at this place,
to acquaint me with your professions of respect
and friendship for the British Government,
bringing along with him many marks of your
hospitality. Need I say I am rejoiced? Such
civilities mark the great.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of the
people.</div>

<p>A voyage of ten days brought us to Bukkur;
but we landed a few miles from that fortress, to
prepare for a visit to Khyrpoor and its chief,
who had made us so welcome in his country.
We saw much of the Sindians on our way up
the river, and did every thing to encourage
their approach by granting free admission on
board to the commonest villager who wished to
view the horses. The body of the people are
little better than savages, and extremely ignorant;
their spiritual guides and Syuds, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
followers of the prophet, however, showed
knowledge and independence. I happened to
ask a party of Syuds to what Ameer they were
subject: they replied, “We acknowledge no
master but God, who gives us villages and all
we desire.” I was struck with the family
likeness that prevails throughout this class in
Sinde; for it is not to be supposed that a tribe
so numerous has lineally descended from the
prophet of Arabia. The beggars of Sinde are
most importunate and troublesome. They practise
all manner of persuasion to succeed in their
suit for alms; tear up grass and bushes with
their mouths, and chew sand and mud to excite
compassion.</p>

<p>With the better orders of society we had
frequent intercourse and conversation. Some of
them felt interested about the objects of our
mission to Lahore. They did not give us
much credit for sincerity in sending it by a
route which they believed never to have been
passed since the time of Noah. They were
full of enquiries regarding our customs. Our
Khyrpoor friend, Mahomed Gohur, was particularly
horrified at our arrangements for getting
a wife, and begged me in future to let my beard
grow. The knowledge of this individual I may
describe, when he asked me if London were
under Calcutta: he was, however, a pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
man; I delighted to hear him sing the praises
of the soldiers of Sinde, who, he said, differed
from all the world in thinking it an honour to
fight on foot. The feelings of pity which some
of the people displayed for us were amusing:
they were shocked to hear that we cleaned our
teeth with hogs’ bristles. I was frequently asked
to lay aside the English saddle, which they considered
quite unworthy, and worse than a seat
on the bare back of the horse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Indus:
names for
it.</div>

<p>The Indus in this part of its course is called
Sira, in distinction from Lar, which is its appellation
below Sehwun. These are two Belooche
words for north and south; and of the name of
Sirae, or Khosa, a tribe inhabiting the desert on
the east, we have thus a satisfactory explanation;
as these people originally spread from Sira, in
the upper course of the Indus. Mehran, a name
of this river, familiar to the Indians and
foreigners, is not used by the natives of the
country. The water of the Indus is considered
superior, for every purpose of life, to that drawn
from the wells of Sinde. When taken from the
river it is very foul; but the rich keep it till the
mud with which it is loaded subsides. There
are few ferry-boats on the Indus; and it is a
curious sight to see the people crossing it on
skins and bundles of reeds. A native will often
float down to a distance of fifteen or twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
miles, accompanied by a whole herd of buffaloes,
preferring this mode of travelling to a journey
on the banks. From Sehwun upwards they kill
the “pulla” fish by nets suspended from the
bow of small boats, which are, at the same time,
the habitations of the fisherman and his family.
The wife, who is generally a sturdy dame, pulls
the stern oar to keep the vessel in the middle of
the stream, often with a baby in her arms, while
the husband kills the fish. One would not have
expected to find porpoises so far from the sea;
but they are to be observed sporting in the river
as high as Bukkur; they are more grey than
those in the salt water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visited by
the Vizier
of Sinde.</div>

<p>I should have mentioned, that before reaching
Bukkur, we were visited by the Nawab
Wulee Mahomed Khan Lugharee, one of the
viziers of Sinde, who had travelled from Shikarpoor
to meet us. We found him a decrepit old
man of seventy-two, on the verge of the grave.
He treated us with particular kindness, and
quite won our hearts by his attentions. He
gave me a horse and a rich loongee. He said in
the plainest terms that the Ameer had had evil
counsel to detain us so long in Sinde, and that
he had written urgently to his Highness not
to commit himself by such a step. We had
now a good opportunity of seeing a Belooche
chief on his native soil. He came with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
splendid equipage of tents and carpets, accompanied
by three palankeens, and about 400
men. A set of dancing girls were among his
suite; and in the evening we were compelled,
against our inclination, to hear these ladies squall
for a couple of hours, and, what added to the
disgust of the scene, they drank at intervals of
the strongest spirits, to <i>clear their voices</i>, as they
said, until nearly intoxicated. It was impossible
to express any displeasure at this exhibition,
since the gala, however much out of taste, was
got up in the hope of adding to our amusement.
The people with us, who now amounted to 150,
were sumptuously entertained by the Nawab,
who kept us with him for two days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vizier of
Khyrpoor.</div>

<p>On the morning of the 14th we disembarked
near the small village of Alipoor, and were met
by the vizier of Meer Roostum Khan, who had
come from Khyrpoor to receive us. His name
was Futteh Khan Ghoree, an aged person of
mild and affable manners, and of peculiar appearance
from a snow white beard and red hair.
Our reception was cordial and kind; the vizier
assured us of the high satisfaction with which
his master had heard of our arrival, for he had
long desired to draw closer to the British government,
and had never yet had the good
fortune to meet any of its agents. He said that
Meer Roostum Khan did not presume to put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
himself on an equality with so potent and great
a nation, but hoped that he might be classed
among its wellwishers, and as one ready to
afford his services on all occasions. Futteh
Khan added that Khyrpoor formed a separate
portion of Sinde from Hydrabad, a fact which
he begged I would remember. I was not altogether
unprepared for this communication, for I
judged from his previous efforts to please that
the ruler had some object in view. I assured the
vizier of my sense of his master’s attentions,
and promised to talk on these matters after our
interview. He brought a palankeen to convey
me in state to Khyrpoor, a distance of fourteen
miles, to which city we marched on the following
day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ameer of
Khyrpoor.</div>

<p>After what I have already stated, our interview
with Meer Roostum Khan may be well
imagined: he received us under a canopy of
silk, seated on a cushion of cloth of gold. He
was surrounded by the members of his family,
forty of whom (males), descended in a right line
from his father, are yet alive. There was more
state and show than at Hydrabad, but as little
attention to order or silence. We exchanged
the usual complimentary speeches of like occasions.
I thanked his Highness for the uniform
attention and hospitality which we had
received. Meer Roostum Khan is about fifty;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
his beard and hair were quite white, and the
expression of his countenance, as well as his
manners, were peculiarly mild. He and his
relatives were too much taken up with our uniforms
and faces to say much; and he begged us
to return in the evening, when there would be
less bustle and confusion, to which we readily
assented. I gave him my watch before leaving,
and sent him a brace of pistols and a kaleidescope,
with various articles of European manufacture,
with which he was highly delighted.
The crowd was hardly to be penetrated, but
very orderly: they shouted as we approached;
and nothing seemed to amuse them so much as
the feathers of our hats. “Such cocks!” was
literally the expression. For about 200 yards
from the palace (if I can use such a term for
the mud buildings of Sinde) there was a street
of armed men, and among them stood thirty or
forty persons with halberds, the foresters or
huntsmen of the household.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Audience
of leave.</div>

<p>In the evening we again visited the Ameer,
and found him seated on a terrace spread with
Persian carpets, and surrounded, as before, by
his numerous relatives. He made a long address
to me regarding his respect for the British government,
and said that I had of course learned
his sentiments from his vizier. He looked to
our Mihmandar from Hydrabad, who I found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
had been doing every thing in his power to prevent
our meeting at all, and then changed the
conversation. The Ameer asked innumerable
questions about England and its power, remarking
that we were not formerly so military a
nation; and he had heard that a few hundred
years ago we went naked and painted our
bodies. On our religion he was very inquisitive;
and when I informed him that I had read
the Koran, he made me repeat the “Kuluma,”
or creed, in Persian and Arabic, to his inexpressible
delight. He said that our greatness
had risen from a knowledge of mankind, and
attending to other people’s concerns as well as
our own. He examined my sword, a small
cavalry sabre, and remarked that it would not
do much harm; but I rejoined, that the age of
fighting with this weapon had passed, which
drew a shout and a sigh from many present.
There was so much mildness in all that the
Ameer said that I could not believe we were in
a Belooche court. He expressed sorrow that we
could not stay a month with him; but since we
were resolved to proceed, we must take his state
barge, and the son of his vizier, to the frontier,
and accept the poor hospitality of a Belooche
soldier, meaning himself, so long as we were in
the Khyrpoor territory. I must mention that
the hospitality, which he so modestly named,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
consisted of eight or ten sheep, with all sorts of
provisions for 150 people daily, and that while
at Khyrpoor he sent for our use, twice a day, a
meal of seventy-two dishes. They consisted of
pillaos and other native viands. The cookery
was rich, and some of them delicious. They
were served up in silver. We quitted Khyrpoor
with regret, after the attentions which we had
received. Before starting, the Ameer and his
family sent to us two daggers, and two beautiful
swords with belts ornamented by large
masses of gold. The blade of one of them
was valued at 80<i>l.</i> To these were added many
cloths and native silks; also a purse of a thousand
rupees, which I did not accept, excusing
myself by the remark that I required nothing
to make me remember the kindness of Meer
Roostum Khan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sindian
rule.</div>

<p>Mr. Elphinstone has remarked, “that the
chiefs of Sinde appear to be barbarians of the
rudest stamp, without any of the barbarous
virtues,” and I fear that there is too much
truth in the character, though the Khyrpoor
family exhibited little to show themselves deserving
of the stigma; but the chiefs of this
country live entirely for themselves. They wallow
in wealth, while their people are wretched.
Professing an enthusiastic attachment to the
religion of Mahommed, they have not even a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
substantial mosque in their territories; and at
Hydrabad, where the town stands on rock, and
indeed every where, they pray in temples of
mud, and seem ignorant of elegance or comfort
in all that concerns domestic arrangement. The
Beloochees are a particularly savage race of
people, but they are brave barbarians. From
childhood they are brought up in arms; and I
have seen some of the sons of chiefs who had
not attained the age of four or five years
strutting about with a shield and a sword of
small size, given by the parents to instil into
them, at that early period, the relish for war.
This tribe composes but a small portion of the
Sindian population; and while they are execrated
by the peaceable classes of the community for
their imperious conduct, they, on the other
hand, hate the princes by whom they are governed.
It would be difficult to conceive a
more unpopular rule, with all classes of their
subjects, than that of the Ameers of Sinde: nor
is the feeling disguised; many a fervent hope
did we hear expressed, in every part of the
country, that we were the forerunners of conquest,
the advance-guard of a conquering army.
The persons of the Ameers are secure from
danger by the number of slaves which they entertain
around their persons. These people are
called “Khaskelees,” and enjoy the confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
of their masters, with a considerable share of
power: they are hereditary slaves, and a distinct
class of the community, who marry only
among themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bukkur.</div>

<p>We marched to Bukkur on the morning of
the 19th, which is a fortress fifteen miles from
Khyrpoor, situated on an insulated rock of flint
on the Indus, with the town of Roree on one
side and Sukkur on the other. It was not to be
supposed that the Ameer would give us permission
to visit this fancied bulwark of his frontier,
and I did not press a demand which I saw
was far from agreeable; but we had good opportunities
of examining the place while passing it,
both on shore and on the river. The island is
about 800 yards long, of an oval shape, almost
entirely occupied by the fortification, which
looks more European than most Indian works:
it is a beautiful object from the banks of the
Indus; its towers are mostly shaded by large
full grown trees, and the tall date drops its
weeping leaves on the mosques and walls. There
are several other islets near it, on one of which
stands the shrine of Khaju Khizr, a holy Mahommedan,
under a dome that contributes to the
beauty of the scene. The Indus rolls past Bukkur
in two streams, each of 400 yards wide, and
the waters lash the rocks which confine them
with noise and violence. During the swell, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
navigation of this part of the river is dangerous,
though the boatmen of Bukkur are both expert
and daring. The town of Roree, which faces
Bukkur, stands on a precipice of flint forty feet
high, and some of its houses, which are lofty,
overhang the Indus. The inhabitants of these
can draw up water from their windows; but a
cut road in the rock supplies the citizens with
this necessary of life without risking their lives.
The opposite bank of Sukkur is not precipitous
like that of Roree. A precious relic, the lock
of Mahommed’s hair, enclosed in a golden box,
attracts the Mahommedan pilgrim to Bukkur,
though the inhabitants are chiefly Hindoos.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grave predictions.</div>

<p>On the banks of the Indus we had a curious
interview in the evening after our arrival with
the Vizier from Khyrpoor, who had been sent
by Meer Roostum Khan to escort us thus far,
and see that we were furnished with boats. After
requesting to be received privately, he renewed
the subject of our first conversation, and said that
he had been instructed by his master to propose
a solemn treaty of friendship with the British
government on any terms that might be named:
he then ran over the list of neighbouring states
which owed their existence to an alliance,&mdash;the
Chief of the Daodpootras, the Rawul of Jaysulmeer,
and the Rajah of Beecaneer, &amp;c. &amp;c. and
then concluded with a peroration full of gravity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
that it was foretold by astronomers, and recorded
in his books, that the English would in time
possess all India, a prediction which both Meer
Roostum and himself felt satisfied would come
to pass, when the British would ask why the
chiefs of Khyrpoor had not come forward with
an offer of allegiance. I tried to remove, but
without effect, the sad prognostications of the
minister, and declared my incompetency to enter
on such weighty matters as a treaty between the
states, without authority and before receiving a
written statement under the Ameer’s seal. I
said that I would make known the wishes that
had been expressed to my government, which
would be gratified to hear they had such
friends, which seemed to please the diplomatist;
he begged that I would bear in mind what had
passed, and exacted a promise that I would
write to him when gone, and so water the tree
of friendship, that the object might be ultimately
effected,&mdash;“for the stars and heaven proclaimed
the fortune of the English!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amusing
incident.</div>

<p>This was not the only incident of interest that
occurred at Bukkur: we had a visit from an
Afghan nobleman of rank, who had been on a
mission to the Governor-General from the late
Shah Mahmood of Herat, and was now on his
return to his native country, by the way of
Sinde and Mekran, the dissensions of dismem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>bered
Cabool preventing his passing by the
usual route. He was one of the finest natives I
ever saw, and had a flowing beard reaching to
his waist: he was full of Calcutta and its wonders,
and had adopted many of our customs.
He rode on an English saddle; but said he had
just found out that it was partly made of hog’s
skin, and brought it to beg my acceptance of it,
for he dared not take such a thing to his country,
and would not again use it. I civilly declined
the offer, and regretted that the information
regarding the materials of the saddle had been
traced to me; for, as he liked our fashions, it
was a pity he could not carry them to his own
country. Previous to the envoy’s leaving us,
he begged I would give him an English brush,
which I did with pleasure; but I did not consider
it necessary to add that, in addition to the
skin of the unclean beast, he would now have
the bristles. He went away in great good
humour with his gift, for which he offered me
his palankeen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mihmandar.</div>

<p>I was sorry that I should have been the means
of giving uneasiness to the Afghan; for it seems
that he acquired his knowledge regarding the
construction of his saddle from our Sindian
Mihmandar, Tukkee Shah, who had taunted him
with uncleanness. This person was a Syud,
one of the strictest Mahommedans I ever met.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
He was a son of Meer Ismael Shah, and of Persian
descent. We found him intelligent and
learned, and his polished manners made us
regret the loss of so agreeable a companion.
He left us at Bukkur, to take temporary charge
of the Shikarpoor district during the absence of
his brother, the Nawab. The character of this
person was singularly disfigured by Mahommedan
bigotry and superstition; while sceptical
and dispassionate on all other topics, there was
no miracle too absurd for his credence in religion.
Among other fables, he assured me that
when the Imam Hoosein had been beheaded
by the Yezeedees, and a Christian reproached
them for murdering their Prophet, one of them
fell on him; the man, instantly seizing the head
of the Imam, placed it on his breast, and it pronounced
the well-known words, “There is no
God but one God, and Mahommed is his
prophet;” which immediately silenced this
Mahommedan Judas!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alore, or
Arore, the
ancient
capital.</div>

<p>While at Bukkur, I visited the ruins of Alore,
which is said to have been once the capital of a
mighty kingdom, ruled by the Dulora Rae,
and on which Roree, Bukkur, and Sukkur, have
risen. It extended from the ocean to Cashmeer,
from Candahar to Kanoje, and was divided into
four vast viceroyalties: the harbour of Diu, in
Kattywar, is expressly mentioned as one of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
sea-ports. It sunk under the Mahommedan
arms so early as the seventh century of the
Christian era, when subdued by the lieutenant
of the Caliph of Bagdad, Mahommed bin Cassim,
who invaded India, according to a Persian
manuscript, in search of ornaments for the seraglio
of the Caliph.</p>

<p>The particulars of its history are to be found
at great length in the Chuchnama, a history of
Sinde in Persian believed to be authentic, and
so called from the ruler of Alore, a Brahmin,
by name Duhr bin Chuch. The ruins of Alore
are yet to be discovered in a rocky ridge four
miles south-east of Bukkur, and are now marked
by an humble hamlet, with some ruined tombs.
A low bridge with three arches, named the
“Bund of Alore or Arore,” constructed of
brick and stone, alone remains of all its greatness.
It is thrown across a valley, which in
by-gone years formed the bed of a branch of
the Indus, from which the waters fertilised the
desert, and reached the sea by Omercote and
Lucput,&mdash;a channel through which they still
find egress in a great inundation.</p>

<p>The description of the battle which overwhelmed
the city of Alore, and terminated the
life and reign of the Dulora Rae, affords some
clue to the manners of the age. The Brahmin
appeared with a train of elephants, on one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
which he was seated, with two females of exquisite
beauty to supply him with wine and the
betel nut. The Mahommedans, unable to oppose
these animals, retired from the field to provide
themselves with combustibles: they filled their
pipes, and returned with them to dart fire at the
elephants, which fled in dismay and disorder<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.
The Raja fell in the action, and his two virgin
daughters, “more beautiful than the morn,”
were despatched to Bagdad as fit ornaments for
the seraglio of the vicegerent of the Prophet.
The story of these ladies deserves mention.
On their arrival at the holy city, they averred
that the General had dishonoured them in the
fever of victory, and the mandate for his death
was forthwith despatched by the Caliph. The
innocent Moslem, sewed up in a raw hide, was
transported from the East to Arabia; and when
his bones were produced in the seraglio, the
daughters of Duhr bin Chuch freely confessed
the falsehood of their accusation, and expressed
their readiness to die, having avenged their
father’s murder. They were dragged to death
in the streets of Bagdad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alore the
kingdom of
Musicanus.</div>

<p>We have recorded the splendour of Alore,
ruled by Brahmins so late as the seventh century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of our era; and history, I think,


<span class="sidenote">Larkhanu,
of Oxycanus.
Minagur
as
Tatta, not
Bukkur.</span>
identifies it with
the kingdom of Musicanus, which Alexander
found to be governed by Brahmins, and the
richest and most populous in India. Here it
was that that conqueror built a fort, as “the
place was commodiously situated for bridling
the neighbouring nations,” and where Mahommed
bin Cassim a thousand years afterwards
subdued the Brahmins who revolted from the
Macedonians. Its prosperity at this late period
confirms the probability of its former wealth.
Bukkur is the ancient Munsoora<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, and has likewise
been supposed to be Minagur, which I
believe is erroneous. The second Arrian, in
his Periplus, speaks of that city as the metropolis
of Sinde, to which the cargo of the ships
was carried up by the river “from Barbarike, a
port in the middle branch of the Indus.” It
has apparently escaped notice, that Minagur is
to be identified with Tatta, as proved by a singular
but convincing fact. The Jhareja Rajpoots
of Cutch, who trace their lineage from
Tatta, invariably designate it in these days by
the name of Sa-Minagur, of which Minagur is
evidently an abbreviation. I look upon the
identity of Tatta and Minagur as conclusive,
though the author of the Periplus never mentions
Pattala. In Reechel we may also have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the harbour of Barbarike. The historians of
Alexander do not inform us of the name of the
country of Musicanus, but only of its ruler.
The position of Larkhanu, on the opposite side
of the Indus, is well marked as the country of
Oxycanus, which was famed for its fertility, since
Alexander despatched from hence his superannuated
soldiers, by the country of the Archoti
and Drangi, to Carmania, or Kerman. The great
road westward branches from Larkhanu, and
crosses the mountains to Kelat by the pass of
Bolan, which is the route to Kerman. The
modern inhabitants of the Indus have no traditions
of the conquest of the Macedonians to
assist the enquirer in a subject that excites among
civilised nations such intense curiosity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quit Bukkur.</div>

<p>On the 21st of May we set sail from Bukkur,
having exchanged our boats for another description
of vessel, called “zohruk,” not in use in
Lower Sinde. They are of an oblong square
shape, rounded fore and aft, and built of the
<i>talee</i> tree, clamped with pieces of iron instead
of nails, an operation which is performed
with great neatness. Some of the vessels exceed
eighty feet in length, and twenty in breadth.
They are flat-bottomed, and pass quicker through
the water than the <i>doondee</i>, though they have
but one mast. By the description of boats
in which Alexander transported his cavalry, I
understand the “zohruk,” which is well suited
for the transport of troops. Arrian describes it
“as of a round form,” and says that they received
no injury on leaving the Hydaspes, when
the long vessels were wrecked. Their peculiar
build has doubtless arisen from the occurrence
of such rapids as the Macedonians experienced
at the junction of the Acesines and Hydaspes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Curiosity
of the
people.</div>

<p>The curiosity of the people on the banks of
the Indus was intense. One man in the crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
demanded that we should stop and show ourselves,
since there had never been a <i>white-face</i>
in this country before, and we were bound
to exhibit, from the welcome which we had
received: he had seen Shah Shooja, he said (the
ex-king of Cabool), but never an Englishman.
Need I say we gratified him and the crowd, of
which he was the spokesman? “Bismilla,” “in
the name of God,” was their usual exclamation
when we appeared, and we daily heard ourselves
styled kings and princes. The ladies
were more curious than their husbands. They
wear ear-rings of large dimensions, with turquoises
suspended or fixed to them; for these
stones are of little value in the vicinity of Khorasan.
Among the women, I should note the
Syudanees, or Bebees, the female descendants of
Mahommed: they go about veiled, or rather with
a long white robe thrown over their entire body,
having netted orifices before the eyes and mouth.
They are all beggars, and very vociferous in
their demands for alms: one set of them, (for
they go about in troops,) when they found I did
not readily meet their demands, produced a
written paper from the shrine of Lal Shah Baz,
at Sehwun, to hasten my charity! Father Manrique,
in his journey by the Indus some centuries
ago, complains “of the frail fair ones”
who molested him by the way. In the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
age, the dress of the courtezans, who are to be
met in every place of size in the country, would
give a favourable idea of the wealth of Sinde;
and it is one of the few, if not the only, amusements
of the inhabitants to listen to the lascivious
songs of these people. They are a remarkably
handsome race, and carry along with them a
spirit of enthusiasm in their performance unknown
to the ladies of Hindoostan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beloochees
of Sinde.</div>

<p>Three days after quitting Bukkur, we came
in sight of the mountains of Cutch Gundava,
distant about a hundred miles from the right
bank of the Indus; the most remarkable peak
was named Gendaree. We here entered a
country inhabited by various Beloochee tribes, long
addicted to piracy and plunder; but their spirit
has been destroyed by the growing power of the
Khyrpoor chiefs. They offered no opposition
or insult; and many came to pay us a friendly
visit. Their manner of saluting each other,
which indeed prevails among all the Beloochees,
is somewhat peculiar. On approaching, they
seize the stranger’s hand, and touch the right
breast with the right shoulder, and the left with
the left, and follow up the words “welcome”
with half a dozen such sentences as, “Are
you happy? Is every thing right? Are all
well, great and small, children and horses?
You are welcome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sinde frontier,
farewell letters.</div>

<p>A very few days brought us beyond the reach
of these Beloochees, and the dominions of Sinde;
for we anchored thirty miles north of Subzulcote,
the frontier town, on the evening of the 26th,
on the line of boundary between the Khan of
the Daoodpootras and the Ameers of Sinde.
Our progress had been exceedingly rapid; for
we had a favourable breeze, and often followed
the lesser branches of the Indus to escape the
violence of the stream. The boats sailed with
celerity; for we came one hundred and twenty
miles by the course of the river in six days
against the stream. We here had a farewell feast
from the Khyrpoor Ameer and Meer Nusseer
Khan, the son of the principal Ameer, who had
shown us marked civility throughout the journey.
After the people had fared sumptuously, our
boats were crowded like sheepfolds. I addressed
valedictory letters to both the Ameers and their
chief ministers, besides several replies to other
persons; for the “<i>cacoethes scribendi</i>” seemed to
have beset the nobles of the land; and I had received,
in one day, no less than six letters. These
productions were full of metaphor and over-strained
expressions of anxiety for our health
and safety, with trite sayings about the advantages
of friendship, and a letter being half an
interview. There is no difference between the
manners of Europe and Asia so striking as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
correspondence. The natives of the East commit
the writing and diction of their compositions
to a native secretary, simply telling him to write
a letter of friendship, congratulation, or whatever
may be the subject, to which he affixes his
seal, sometimes without a perusal. If the signet
is not legible, one may often try in vain to find
out his correspondent; for he never names himself
in his letter. In my epistles, I told the
Khyrpoor chief that his friendship and kindness
had brought us without an accident, and with
unprecedented speed, against the mighty stream
of the Indus; and I thought it as well, for the
edification of the Hydrabad Ameer, to add, that
<i>the Indus was a navigable river</i> from the ocean,
and had abundance of water every where! I did
not quit Sinde favourably impressed, either with
his character or policy; but we should not try
such a man by an European standard, and he
doubtless opposed our choice of the route by the
Indus on sufficiently good grounds. I parted
from our Khyrpoor friends really with reluctance;
for their hospitality and kindness had been great,
and it was with difficulty that I was permitted
to reward the boatmen. The Mihmandar said
that he had been ordered to prohibit it; and his
master only desired to please the British Government.
This person was very inferior to our
former companion the Syud; but, if less learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
and intelligent, he had the more sterling qualities
of sincerity and honesty: his name was Inayut
Khan Ghoree.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sindian
escort.</div>

<p>We here dismissed, and with regret, our
Sindian escort, which had followed us from the
mouths of the Indus. They seemed to have
become attached to us, and followed us in our
walks and rides with unusual alacrity; as we
were leaving, they accompanied us to the water’s
edge, with loud cries of thanks for our kindness
and prayers for our welfare. They consisted of
twenty-four men; twelve of whom were Beloochees
and the rest Jokeeas, a tribe of mountaineers
near Curachee. We had not, I am sure,
done much to deserve such gratitude; for they
had only received an additional month’s pay
(eight rupees each) to take them back to their
country, a distance of three hundred and fifty
miles. Some of them begged to accompany us
to Lahore; but, on the same principle that they
had been hired in Sinde, it would be proper to
enlist natives of the new country we were entering,
and I civilly declined their request. These
men used to kill game for us; and were ever
ready to anticipate our wishes. Their honesty
we found unimpeachable; and we never lost
any thing in our progress through a strange
country, protected by strangers on whom we had
no tie, and who had been brought from the fields
to enter our service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fish diet.</div>

<p>The natives of the neighbouring countries,
and the higher class of people in Sinde, have a
singular notion regarding the fish diet of the
inhabitants. They believe it prostrates the
understanding; and, in palliation of ignorance
in any one, often plead that “he is but a fish-eater.”
The lower order of the Sindians live
entirely on fish and rice; and the prevailing
belief must be of an old date, as they tell an
anecdote of one of the Emperors of Delhi who
addressed a stranger in his court with the
question from whence he came; he replied,
from Tatta, and the king turned away his head.
The stranger, recollecting the prejudice against
his country, immediately rejoined, that he was
not a “fish-eater.” I am not prepared to state
how far a fish diet may affect the intellect of the
Sindian, but I certainly remarked the prolific
nature of the food in the number of children on
the banks of the Indus.


<span class="sidenote">Manners,
&amp;c. Costume.</span>
The greatest fault
which an European would find with the people
of Sinde is their filthy habits. They always
wear dark-coloured garments from religious
motives; but the ablutions of the Prophet are
little attended to. People must be in easy
circumstances, I believe, or cease to feel want
before they adopt habits of cleanliness. The
change of costume in the people, announced
already a change of country. Since leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Bukkur, we had met many Afghans and natives
of the kingdom of Cabool. The boots of some
of these strangers, made of variegated leather,
ribbed, in some instances, not unlike the skin of
the tiger, formed an extraordinary dress for a
long-bearded old man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quit Sinde.
Bhawul
Khan’s
country.</div>

<p>In the evening of the 27th we quitted Sinde,
and ascended the river for a few miles, where
we were met by Gholam Kadir Khan, a Nuwab
and person of high rank, who had been sent to
welcome us by Bhawul Khan, the chief of the
Daoodpootras, in whose country we had now
arrived. He was a little, pot-bellied old man,
with a happy expression of countenance; and
he said that he was sent to communicate the delight
with which his master hailed our approach.
He brought a most kind message&mdash;that a fleet
of fifteen boats had been collected, and was now
in readiness to convey us through the Daoodpootra
country, while the Khan had fitted up a
boat expressly for our accommodation. He
brought likewise a purse of a hundred rupees,
which he said he had been desired to send me
daily: this I declined, saying, that money was
useless where every necessary and luxury of
life was furnished by his master’s hospitality.
We soon got on easy terms with our new hosts,
and weighed anchor next evening for the frontier
village, where we halted. Many Daoodpootras<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
came to see us; they differ in appearance from
the Sindians, and wear turbans formed of tight
and round folds of cloths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quit the
Indus.</div>

<p>On the 30th of May our fleet, now swelled to
eighteen boats, quitted the Indus at Mittuncote,
where it receives the united waters of the Punjab
rivers; and, as if to remind us of its magnitude,
the stream was here wider than in any other
part of its course, and exceeded 2000 yards.
We took a last farewell of its waters, and entered
the Chenab or Acesines of the Greeks.
Alexander sailed down this river to the Indus;
but no tradition of that event is preserved on
its banks. The Sindians point to Cabool as the
theatre of his exploits, where Sikunder the
Persian achieved many memorable deeds. In
the East, as in the West, there have not been
wanting ages of darkness to draw a mist over
truth, and substitute, in poetical language, the
fables of an Eastern country for one of the most
authentic facts in ancient history&mdash;the voyage
of Alexander on the Indus. Mittun is a small
town, about a mile distant from the Indus, and
occupies, I imagine, the site of one of the
Grecian cities, since the advantage of its position
for commerce attracted the attention of
Alexander.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elevated
houses of
Sinde.</div>

<p>In Lower Sinde the pastoral tribes live in
reed houses, and rove from one place to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>other.
In these parts of the Indus they dwell
in habitations elevated eight or ten feet from
the ground, to avoid the damp and the insects
occasioned by it. These are also built of reeds,
and entered by a ladder. They are small neat
cottages, and occupied by wandering tribes, who
frequent the banks of the river till the season
of inundation. Herodotus mentions that the
Egyptians slept in turrets during the rise of the
Nile.


<span class="sidenote">Effects of
the Indus
on the
climate.</span>
The inhabitants have strange notions
regarding the influence of the Indus on the
climate. They believe that it gives out a perpetual
breeze; and they, therefore, seek a habitation
near it, for the heat of Sinde is most
oppressive. The father of history expressed
his belief that such also was the case with the
Nile; and it is curious that a similar opinion
should be entertained by the people of Sinde.
I can readily understand that a vast volume of
running water would cool the banks of a river:
the heat is said to increase on receding from the
Indus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chenab or
Acesines.</div>

<p>We reached Ooch, where the joint streams
of the Sutlege and Beas, here called the Garra,
fall into the Chenab. The name of Punjnud,
or Five Rivers, is unknown to the natives;
and we now navigated the Chenab or Acesines
of the Greeks, the name of the five rivers
being lost in that of the greater stream. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
is curious to observe that this fact is expressly
mentioned by Arrian:&mdash;“The Acesines retains
its name till it falls at last into the Indus,
after it has received three other rivers.” The
Sutlege, or Hesudrus, is not mentioned by Alexander’s
historians. These united rivers form a
noble stream; and the banks of the Chenab are
free from the thick tamarisk jungles of the
Indus. They were studded with innumerable
hamlets, particularly towards the Indus; for the
rich pasture attracts the shepherd.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incident.</div>

<p>Our arrival at Ooch had been so much earlier
than was anticipated as to give rise to an incident
which might have proved serious. The
troops of Bhawul Khan were encamped on the
banks of the river, and in a dusky day our
numerous fleet was mistaken for the Seik army,
which had been threatening to invade his territories.
A discharge of a cannon and some musquetry
arrested the progress of our advanced
boat. The mistake was readily discovered, and
the chagrin and vexation that followed afforded
us some amusement. I thought that apologies
and regrets would never have ceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ooch.</div>

<p>The town of Ooch stands on a fertile plain at
a distance of four miles from the Acesines, beautifully
shaded by trees. It is formed of three
distinct towns, a few hundred yards apart from
each other, and each has been encompassed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
a wall of brick, now in ruins. The population
amounts to 20,000. The streets are narrow, and
covered with mats as a protection from the sun;
but it is a mean place. We were accommodated
in a garden well stocked with fruit trees and
flowers, which was an agreeable change from
our confined boats.


<span class="sidenote">Arrival of
Bhawul
Khan.</span>
When preparing for a
journey to visit the Khan,&mdash;who was absent at
Dirawul, in the desert,&mdash;we were surprised by
the arrival of a messenger, with the information
that he had reached Ooch from a distance of
sixty miles, that he might save us the trouble of
coming to him, and evince his respect for the
British Government. The messenger brought
us a deer, which the Khan had shot, and of
which he begged our acceptance, with forty vessels
of sherbet, and as many of sweetmeats and
preserves; also a bag containing 200 rupees,
which he requested I would distribute in charity,
to mark the joyful event of our arrival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interview
with him.</div>

<p>On the morning of the 3d of June we visited
Bhawul Khan, who had alighted at a large
house outside the town, a mile distant: he sent
an escort of his regular troops, with horses,
palankeens, and various other conveyances,&mdash;one
of which deserves description. It was a
sort of chair, covered with a red canopy of
cloth, supported by two horses, one in front and
the other behind, and the most awkward vehicle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
that can be imagined; for it could be turned
with difficulty, and the horses did not incline to
such a burden. We passed a line of soldiers,
about 600 in number, dressed in uniforms of
red, blue, white, and yellow; and then entered
the court yard, under a salute of eighty
guns. The passages were lined with officers
and chiefs; and we found the Khan seated in
an area spread with carpets, attended only by
about ten persons: he rose and embraced us.
He made particular enquiries regarding Mr.
Elphinstone, who, he said, had been the means
of raising up a sincere and lasting friendship
between his family and the British Government.</p>

<p>Bhawul Khan is a handsome man, about
thirty years of age, somewhat grave in his demeanour,
though most affable and gentlemanlike;
during the interview he held a rosary in
his hand, but the telling of the beads did not interrupt
his conversation. He dilated at length
on the honour which Runjeet Sing had had conferred
upon him in receiving presents from the
King of Great Britain; nor did he, in any way,
betray his feelings towards the Lahore chief,
though they are far from friendly. The Khan,
unlike most natives, seemed to avoid all political
subjects. He produced his matchlock, and explained
to us his manner of hunting deer, his
favourite sport; and expressed a strong wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
that we should accompany him to his residence
in the desert. We left him quite charmed with
his kindness, and the sincere manner in which
he had shown it. In the evening the Khan
sent for our perusal the testimonials that had
been given to his grandfather by Mr. Elphinstone,
which are preserved with great pride and
care in the archives of his government. For my
own part, I felt equal satisfaction to find the
English character stand so high in this remote
corner of India, and the just appreciation of the
high-minded individual who had been the means
of fixing it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Merchants
at Bhawulpoor.</div>

<p>During our stay at Ooch, we were visited by
some of the principal merchants of Bhawulpoor,
who had followed the Khan. The intelligence
of these people, and extent of their travels, surprised
me. Most of them had traversed the
kingdom of Cabool, and visited Balkh and Bokhara:
some had been as far as Astracan; and
they used the names of these towns with a
familiarity as if they had been in India. They
had met Russian merchants at Bokhara, but
assured me that they never came to the eastward
of that city. The intervening countries they
represented as perfectly safe, and bestowed the
highest commendations on Dost Mahommed, of
Cabool, and the Uzbeks, who encouraged commercial
communication. These merchants are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
chiefly Hindoos, whose disposition peculiarly
adapts them for the patient and painstaking
vocation of a foreign merchant. Some of them
are Jews, who retain the marks of their nation
in all countries and places.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">History of
Ooch.</div>

<p>We continued at Ooch for a week. The place
is ancient, and highly celebrated in the surrounding
countries from the tombs of two saints of
Bokhara and Bagdad. The Ghorian emperors
expelled the Hindoo Rajas of Ooch, and consigned
the surrounding lands to pious Mahommedans.
The tombs of the two worthies I have
named are handsome, and held in much reverence
by the people; they are about five hundred
years old, and tradition is silent regarding the
history of the place beyond that period. The
posterity of these saints enjoy both spiritual and
temporal power to the present day; but, instead
of ministering to the wants of the inhabitants,
who are needy and poor, they waste their
fortunes in the chase, and retain hounds and
horses for their amusement. An inundation of
the Acesines, some years back, swept away one
half of the principal tomb, with a part of the
town; and, though the return of the river to its
original bed is attributed to the miraculous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
interference of the deceased saint, the people
have, as yet, failed to testify their gratitude by
repairing his tomb. The town of Ooch stands
on a mound of earth or clay, like the city of
Tatta, which I judge to have been formed by
the ruins of houses. The Chenab has swept
away a portion of the mound; and the section
of it which has been thus exposed seems to
support the conjecture which I have stated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit from
Bhawul
Khan.</div>

<p>On the 5th of June we had a visit from
Bhawul Khan. He insisted on coming in person
to see us; and sent a large tent to be pitched
by our garden, in which we received him. He
sat for about an hour; and put numerous
questions regarding the manufactures of Europe.
The chief is of a mechanical turn of mind; he
produced a detonating gun, which had been
made under his directions from an European
pattern, and certainly did credit to the artificer;
he had also manufactured the necessary caps
and fulminating powder. He expressed, at
this interview, much satisfaction with the presents
which we had sent him; they consisted of
a brace of pistols, a watch, and some other
articles. The Khan came in an open sort of
chair, to which we conducted him on his departure.
He was attended by about a thousand
persons; and I observed that he distributed
money as he passed along. After the visit, our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Mihmandar brought us presents from the Khan;
they consisted of two horses richly caparisoned
with silver and enamel trappings, a hawk, with
shawls and trays of the fabrics made at Bhawulpoor,
some of which were very rich; to these
were added a purse of 2000 rupees, and a sum
of 200 for the servants; and, last of all, a beautiful
matchlock, which had its value doubled
by the manner in which it was presented. “The
Khan,” said the messenger, “has killed many
a deer with this gun; and he begs you will
accept it from him, and, when you use it,
remember that Bhawul Khan is your friend.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Audience
of leave.</div>

<p>In the evening we had a parting interview
with Bhawul Khan. I gave him a handsome
percussion gun; and assured him, what I felt
most sincerely, that we should long remember
his kindness and hospitality. He embraced
us on our leaving him; and intreated us to
write to him and command his services. The
courtiers and people were as polite as their
chief.</p>

<p>We left Ooch on the following morning, and
pitched our camp at the junction of the Chenab
with the Garra, or united streams of the Beas
and Sutlege.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mountains
of Sooliman.</div>

<p>The country about Ooch is flat and exceedingly
rich; there are many signs of inundation
between the town and the river. The dust was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
most intolerable; but it always cleared up
towards evening, and we saw the sun set in
splendour behind the mountains of Sooliman
across the Indus, eighty miles distant. They
did not appear high, and were not distinguished
by any remarkable peaks. It is a
little below the latitude of Ooch that they
assume a direction parallel to the Indus, which
they afterwards preserve. We lost sight of the
range on our voyage to Mooltan the day after
leaving Ooch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Embouchure
of the
Sutlege.</div>

<p>On the morning of the 7th we passed the
mouth of the Sutlege, and continued our voyage
on the Chenab to the frontiers of Bhawul Khan,
which we reached on the evening of the 8th.
The Chenab receives the Sutlege without
turmoil, and appears quite as large above as
below the conflux. The waters of either river
are to be distinguished some miles below the
junction by their colour: that of the Chenab
is reddish; and, when joined by the Sutlege,
the waters of which are pale, the contrast is
remarkable. For some distance the one river
keeps the right, and the other the left, bank;
the line of demarcation between the two being
most decided. The nature of the soil through
which the Chenab flows, no doubt, tinges its
waters. This peculiarity is well known to the
natives, who speak of the “red water,” but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
none of the ancient authors allude to the circumstance.
The nature of the country between
Ooch and the Indus has been mistaken, as it is
never flooded. Several decayed canals, if cleared,
would yet lead the water of the Chenab to the
Indus, and may account for Major Rennell’s
conducting that river into the great stream, so
many miles above the true point of union, until
the geographical error was rectified by the mission
to Cabool.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mihmandar.</div>

<p>We parted with our Mihmandar, Gholam
Cadir Khan, before passing into the Seik territory.
We had seen a great deal of him, and
found him well informed on all such subjects as
he could be supposed to know. He carried four
or five historical works with him, among which
was the Chuchnamu, or History of Sinde, to
which I have alluded, one or two books on
medicine, and some volumes of poetry: yet he
made a most particular request, at our last interview,
that I would tell him the secret of
magic, which he was certain we possessed. I
assured him of the error under which he laboured:
“But,” said he, “how is it that you
have had a favourable wind ever since I met
you, and performed a twenty days’ voyage in
five, when a breath of air does not sometimes
stir in this country for months?” I told him
that such was the good fortune of the English.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
When the Nawaub found me wanting in the black
art, he whispered that he himself was a dealer
in spells and magic; but very sensibly added,
that he had no faith in his own incantations,
high as they stood in the opinion of others;
though it was not his part to say so. He begged
I would give him some medicine to prevent
him growing fatter; but neither regular exercise,
nor vinegar, which I prescribed, seemed to
suit his taste. What a whimsical creature man
is. In Sinde, every person of rank seeks for
rotundity to support his dignity; and but a few
miles from that country, the “martyr to obesity”
is considered unfortunate.</p>

<p>There is little cordiality subsisting between
the Seiks and Bhawul Khan; and it was with
the utmost difficulty that I prevailed on the
Nawaub to let us proceed to the Seik camp, a
distance of six miles, in the boats belonging
to his master. “The Seiks,” he said, “are
my master’s enemies, and no boat of ours
shall cross their frontier.” He at last assented,
on my becoming answerable for the return of
the vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Runjeet
Sing’s
country.</div>

<p>A few hours’ sail brought us to the place of
rendezvous late at night, and the fires of the
soldiers blazing in the darkness only increased
our anxiety to meet our new friends. It was
the camp of the party which had been sent from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Lahore to await our arrival, and had long expected
us. Immediately on landing, we were
received by Sirdar Lenu Sing, who came with
considerable state on an elephant, and was attended
by a large retinue. The Sirdar was
richly dressed, and had a necklace of emeralds,
and armlets studded with diamonds. In one
hand he held a bow, and in the other two Persian
letters in silken bags. He congratulated us, in
the name of Maharajah Runjeet Sing, on our
arrival, and had been desired by his Highness to
communicate that he was deeply sensible of the
honour conferred upon him by the King of
England, and that his army had been for some
time in readiness on the frontier, to chastise the
barbarians of Sinde, who had so long arrested
our progress. He then delivered to me the
letters which appointed himself as our Mihmandar,
in conjunction with two other persons; presenting
at the same time a bow, according to
the custom of the Seiks. On the ceremony being
terminated, the Sirdar and several others placed
bags of money at my feet, amounting to about
1400 rupees, and then withdrew.</p>

<p>The first intercourse with a new people can
never be destitute of interest, and the present
was far from being so.</p>

<p>These Seiks are tall and bony men, with a very
martial carriage: the most peculiar part of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
dress is a small flat turban, which becomes them
well; they wear long hair, and from the knee
downwards do not cover the leg. When the
deputation had withdrawn, an escort of regular
troops attended to receive orders, and sentries
were planted round our camp. It was novel to
hear the words of command given in the French
language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exhibition
of the dray
horses.</div>

<p>No sooner had the day broke, than the Maharajah’s
people evinced much anxiety to view
the dray horses, and we had them landed for
exhibition. Their surprize was extreme; for
they were little elephants, said they, and not
horses. Their manes and tails seemed to please,
from their resemblance to the hair of the cow of
Thibet; and their colour, a dappled grey, was
considered a great beauty. It was not without
difficulty that I replied to the numerous questions
regarding them; for they believed that the
presents of the King of England must be extraordinary
in every way; and for the first time, a
dray horse was expected to gallop, canter, and
perform all the evolutions of the most agile
animal. Their astonishment reached its height
when the feet of the horses were examined; and
a particular request was made of me to permit
the despatch of one of the shoes to Lahore, as it
was found to weigh 100 rupees, or as much as
the four shoes of a horse in this country. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
curiosity was forthwith despatched by express,
and accompanied by the most minute measurement
of each of the animals, for Runjeet Sing’s
special information. The manner in which this
rarity was prized, will be afterwards seen, when
it is gravely recorded, that the new moon turned
pale with envy on seeing it!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civilities.</div>

<p>Our own comforts were not forgotten among
their wonder and admiration, for the attentions
of the people were of the most marked description.
Our Mihmandar said that he had the
strictest injunctions regarding our reception;
and he rigidly acted up to the spirit of the following
document, which will best show the distinguished
and kind manner we were treated in
the territories of Maharajah Runjeet Sing.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Purwanu
of Runjeet
Sing.</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Copy of the Maharajah’s “Purwanu,” or
Command to his Officers.</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Be it known to Dewan Adjoodia Pursad,
Monsieur Chevalier Ventura, and the great
and wise Sirdar Lenu Sing, and Lalla Sawun
Mull, Soobadar of Mooltan, that when Mr.
Burnes reaches the frontier, you are immediately
to attend to all his wants, and previously
despatch 200 infantry and the lancers,
under Tajee Sing, to Julalpoor, that they
may be ready on his arrival as an honorary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
escort; and you are at the same time to make
known your own arrival in the neighbourhood.
When Mr. Burnes approaches, you are immediately
to despatch an elephant, with a silver
houda, in charge of the Dewan, who is to
state that the animal has been sent for his
own express use, and then ask him to be
seated thereon, which will be gratifying, as
the friendship between the states is great.</p>

<p>“When Mr. Burnes has mounted the elephant,
then shall the Sirdar Lenu Sing, and
Sawun Mull, seated on other elephants, approach,
and have an interview with that gentleman,
paying him every manner of respect and
attention in their power, and congratulating
him in a hundred ways on his safe arrival
from a long and distant journey, distributing
at the same time 225 rupees among the poor.
You are then to present a handsome bow, and
each of you eleven gold Venetians, and conduct
the gentleman to the halting-place, and
there set before him 1100 rupees, and fifty
jars of sweetmeats. You are then to supply
the following articles: grass, grain, bran,
milk, eggs, fowls, sheep (doombus), curds,
vegetables, fruit, roses, spices, water-vessels,
beds, and every other thing that may be necessary,
in quantities without bounds, and be
neglectful and dilatory in nothing. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
you visit, you are to parade the two companies
and the horse, and salute, and then
place guards according to Mr. Burnes’ pleasure.</p>

<p>“When you reach Shoojuabad, you are to
fire a salute of eleven guns, and furnish every
thing as before directed, and present 1100
rupees, with sweetmeats and fruits, and attend
to every wish that is expressed. If Mr.
Burnes desires to look at the fort of Shoojuabad,
you are to attend on him and show it,
and see there is no obstruction, and that no
one even raises his voice.</p>

<p>“On reaching Mooltan, you are to conduct
Mr. Burnes with great respect, and pitch his
camp in whatever garden he shall select; the
Huzooree, the Begee, the Shush Muhl, or
the Khass wu Am, or any other. You are
then to present him with a purse of 2500
rupees, and 100 jars of sweetmeats, and fire a
salute of eleven guns from the ramparts of
the fortress. When you have complimented
him on his arrival, you are to suggest for his
consideration, whether he would not like to
halt at Mooltan for five or six days after his
long journey, and act entirely as he desires;
if he wishes to view the fort, you three persons
are to attend him, and allow no one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
make a noise, and take most particular care
that the Nihungs, and such other wrong-headed
people, are kept at a distance.</p>

<p>“In quitting Mooltan, you are to load 100
camels with provisions for the supply of Mr.
Burnes to Lahore, and Soobadar Sawan Mull
is to attend him in person for the first stage,
and after taking leave, repair to the camp of
Monsieur Chevalier Ventura. Sirdar Lenu
Sing and Dewan Adjoodia Pursad, together
with Futih Sing Ramgurree, accompanied by
an escort of two companies and the lancers,
shall attend Mr. Burnes, and proceed by easy
stages to Lahore, despatching daily notice of
his approach. At Dehra, Syudwulla the Kardar
is to present 1100 rupees, with the usual
sweetmeats; and you are all directed to remember,
in every instance, and at all times,
the great friendship which subsists between
the two states.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is at all times much display and hyperbole
in affairs of this description throughout the
East; but in the present instance it will be
observed, that the Maharajah not only evinced
his liberality in other matters, but in throwing
open to our inspection the strong holds of his
country, which can be duly appreciated by those
only who have experienced the extreme jealousy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of most Indian governments. The Seik Sirdars
in attendance on us were likewise most communicative;
and this is the more remarkable, as it
could not have escaped the Maharajah, that in
taking the unfrequented tract we had followed
on the Indus we were seeking for new information,
after the spirit of our country.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">Voyage in
the Seik
country.</div>

<p>By the 12th of June, our preparations for the
voyage were completed, and we again embarked
on the Chenab. The boats here were of a very
inferior description, still called “zohruq;” they
had no sails, and hoist a mat on a low mast
instead; their waists are scarcely a foot above
water, and those which they could collect for us,
were but the different ferry boats of the river.
There is no trade carried on by water in this
country, and there are in consequence no boats.
A sail of a few hours brought us to the ferry
opposite Shoojuabad, where we halted. The
country is of the richest and most fertile description,
and its agricultural resources are much
increased, by conducting water to the remoter
parts, in large canals and aqueducts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shoojuabad.</div>

<p>In the evening of the 13th we visited the
town of Shoojuabad, which stands four miles
eastward of the river. It is a thriving place,
surrounded by a fine wall of brick, about thirty
feet high. The figure of the place is that of an
oblong square, and the wall is strengthened by
octagonal towers, at equal distances. The in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>terior
is filled up with houses, which are built in
streets, at right angles to one another; and a
suburb of huts surrounds the walls. Shoojuabad
fort was built by the Nuwab of Mooltan in the
year 1808, and the public spirit of that person
raised it, in the course of ten years, to great
opulence. It is situated in a most beautiful
country, and is watered by two spacious canals
for many miles, both above and below the town.
It was captured by the Seiks, along with Mooltan,
and now forms the frontier fortress of the
Lahore chief. We were accompanied to Shoojuabad
by our Mihmandar, who appeared in
state for the occasion; he sat on an elephant in
a chair of silver,&mdash;two horses were led before
him, with saddles of red and yellow velvet,&mdash;his
bow and quiver were borne by one menial,
and his sword by another; while he himself was
decorated with precious jewels. At the palace
of the town, we were met by many of the respectable
inhabitants, before whom the “zyafut,”
or money gift, and sweetmeats of the Maharajah,
were presented to us. We afterwards
were conducted through the principal street,
and welcomed in a gratifying manner, wherever
we went. On quitting the fortress the garrison
fired a salute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mooltan.</div>

<p>On the 15th we came in sight of the domes
of Mooltan, which look well at a distance; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
alighted in the evening at the Hoozooree Bagh,
a spacious garden enclosed by a thin wall of
mud, a mile distant from the city. The ground
is laid out in the usual native style; two spacious
walks crossed each other at right angles, and
are shaded by large fruit trees, of the richest
foliage. In a bungalow, at the end of one of
these walks, we took up our quarters, and were
received by the authorities of the city in the
same hospitable manner as at Shoojuabad. They
brought a purse of 2500 rupees, with 100
vessels of sweetmeats, and an abundant supply
of fruit: we felt happy and gratified at the
change of scene, and civilities of the people.</p>

<p>The city of Mooltan, is described in Mr.
Elphinstone’s work on Cabool, and it may appear
foreign to my purpose to mention it; but his
mission was received here with great jealousy,
and not permitted to view the interior of the
town, or the fort. I do not hesitate, therefore,
to add the following particulars, drawn up after
a week’s residence. The city of Mooltan is
upwards of three miles in circumference, surrounded
by a dilapidated wall, and overlooked
on the north by a fortress of strength. It
contains a population of about 60,000 souls, one
third of whom may be Hindoos; the rest of the
population is Mahommedan, for though it is
subject to the Seiks, their number is confined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the garrison, which does not exceed 500 men.
The Afghans have left the country, since they
ceased to govern. Many of the houses evidently
stand on the ruins of others: they are built of
burnt brick, and have flat roofs: they sometimes
rise to the height of six stories, and their loftiness
gives a gloomy appearance to the narrow streets.
The inhabitants are chiefly weavers and dyers
of cloth. The silk manufacture of Mooltan is
called “kais,” and may be had of all colours,
and from the value of 20 to 120 rupees: it is
less delicate in texture than the “loongees” of
Bhawulpoor. Runjeet Sing has with much propriety
encouraged their manufacture, since he
captured the city; and by giving no other cloths
at his court, has greatly increased their consumption,
and they are worn as sashes and scarfs
by all the Seik Sirdars. They are also exported
to Khorasan and India, and the duties levied
are moderate. To the latter country, the route
by Jaysulmeer and Beecaneer is chosen in preference
to that by Sinde, from the trade being
on a more equitable footing. The trade of
Mooltan is much the same as at Bhawulpoor,
but is on a larger scale, for it has forty Shroffs,
(money changers) chiefly natives of Shikarpoor.
The tombs of Mooltan are celebrated: one of
them, that of Bawulhuq, who flourished upwards
of 500 years ago, and was a contemporary of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Sadee the Persian poet, is considered very holy;
but its architecture is surpassed by that of his
grandson, Rookn-i-Allum, who reposes under
a massy dome sixty feet in height, which was
erected in the year 1323, by the Emperor Tooghluck,
as his own tomb. Its foundation stands on
higher ground than the summit of the fort wall;
there is also a Hindoo temple of high antiquity,
called Pyladpooree; mentioned by Thevenot in
1665.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fort of
Mooltan.</div>

<p>The fortress of Mooltan merits a more particular
description; it stands on a mound of
earth, and is an irregular figure of six sides, the
longest of which (towards the north-west) extends
for about 400 yards. The wall has upwards
of thirty towers, and is substantially built
of burnt brick, to the height of forty feet outside;
but in the interior, the space between the ground
and its summit does not exceed four or five feet,
and the foundations of some of the buildings
overtop the wall, and are to be seen from the
plain below. The interior is filled with houses, and
till its capture by the Seiks in 1818, was peopled,
but the inhabitants are not now permitted to
enter, and a few mosques and cupolas, more
substantially built than the other houses, alone
remain among the ruins. The fortress of Mooltan
has no ditch; the nature of the country will not
admit of one being constructed; and Runjeet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Sing has hitherto expended great sums without
effect. The inundation of the Chenab, and its
canals, together with rain, render the vicinity
of Mooltan a marsh, even in the hot weather,
and before the swell of the river has properly set
in, the waters of last year remain. The walls
of the fortress are protected in two places by
dams of earth; the modern fort of Mooltan was
built on the site of the old city, by Moorad
Bukhsh, the son of Shah Jehan, about the year
1640, and it subsequently formed the Jagheer of
that prince’s brothers, the unfortunate Daro
Shikoh, and the renowned Aurungzebe. The
Afghans seized it in the time of Ahmed Shah,
and the Seiks wrested it from the Afghans, after
many struggles, in 1818. The conduct of its
governor during the siege, deserves mention;
when called on to surrender the keys, and
offered considerate treatment, he sent for reply,
that they would be found in his heart, but he
would never yield to an infidel; he perished
bravely in the breach. His name, Moozuffur
Khan, is now revered as a saint, and his tomb is
placed in one of the holiest sanctuaries of
Mooltan. The Seiks threw down the walls of
the fort in many places, but they have since
been thoroughly renewed or repaired; they are
about six feet thick, and could be easily breached
from the mounds that have been left in baking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
the bricks, which are within cannon range of
the walls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Antiquity
of Mooltan
supposed
Capital of
the Malli.</div>

<p>Mooltan is one of the most ancient cities in
India. We read of its capture by Mahommed-bin-Cassim,
in the first century of the Hejira,
and its wealth afterwards attracted the Ghiznian,
Ghorian, and Moghul emperors of Hindoostan.
But we have little reason to doubt its being the
capital of the Malli of Alexander: Major Rennell
has supposed that metropolis to have been higher
up, and nearer the banks of the Ravee, because
Arrian states, that the inhabitants fled across
that river. This is high authority, but Mooltan
is styled “Malli than,” or “Malitharun” the place
of the Malli, to this day, and we have no ruins
near Tolumba, the site pointed at by Rennell to
fix on as the supposed capital. It is expressly
stated that Alexander crossed the Ravee, and
after capturing two towns, led his forces to the
capital city of the Malli. As the distance from
the river is but thirty miles, and Mooltan is considered
a place of high antiquity, I do not see
why we should forsake the modern capital when
in search of the ancient: had we not the earliest
assurances of the age of Mooltan, its appearance
would alone indicate it. The houses are piled
upon ruins, and the town stands on a mound of
clay, the materials of former habitations which
have gradually crumbled, an infallible proof of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
antiquity, as I have remarked of Tatta and Ooch.
The late Nawab of Mooltan, in sinking a well
in the city, found a war drum, at a depth of
sixty feet from the surface; and several other
articles have been from time to time collected,
but no coins have been hitherto seen. Mooltan
may, in some degree, be considered to answer
the description of the Brahmin city and its
castle, which Alexander captured, before attacking
the capital of the Malli; but in that case, we
should have no site to fix on as the capital. The
manufactures of Mooltan and Bhawulpoor, the
“kais” and “loungee,” seem to assist in fixing
the country of the Malli, for Quintus Curtius
informs us that the ambassadors of the Malli
and Oxydracæ (Mooltan and Ooch) “wore
garments of cotton, lawn or muslin (lineæ
vestes), interwoven with gold, and adorned with
purple,” and we may safely translate “lineæ
vestes,” into the stuffs of Mooltan and Bhawulpoor,
which are interwoven with gold, and
most frequently of a purple colour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buildings
of Mooltan.
Superstitions.</div>

<p>During our stay at Mooltan, we were freely
conducted to view the lions of this decayed
Viceroyalty of the Mogul empire. In the interior
of the fort there is the Hindoo temple,
before alluded to, which its votaries believe to
be of boundless antiquity, and with it couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the following tradition. One Hurnakus, a giant,
despised God, and worshipped himself; he desired
his son Pylad to follow his steps, and was
about to murder him for his contumacy, when
the youth was miraculously saved by an incarnation
of the Deity, who appeared in a shape of
half lion and man. Hurnakus had given out
that his death could never be effected in earth
or air, in fire or water, by sword or bow, by night
or day; and it happened without an infringement
of these conditions, for Nursingavater
(the name of the incarnation) seized him at
dusk, and placing him on his knee, tore Hurnakus
to pieces, and took his son under protection.
This Hindoo temple, which goes by
the name of Pyladpooree, is a low building, supported
by wooden pillars, with the idols Hooneeman
and Guneesa as guardians to its portal.
It is the only place of Hindoo worship in Mooltan;
we were denied entrance to it.</p>

<p>There is a shrine of some celebrity, near the
walls of Mooltan, where rest the remains of
Shumsi-Tabreezee, a saint from Bagdad, who is
believed to have performed many miracles, and
even raised the dead. This worthy, as the story
is told, was flayed alive for his pretensions. He
had long begged his bread in the city, and in
his hunger caught a fish, which he held up to the
sun, and brought that luminary near enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
roast it; this established his memory and equivocal
fame on a firmer basis. The natives to
this day attribute the heat of Mooltan, which is
proverbial, to this incident.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reflections.</div>

<p>In the ready belief which the inhabitants of
Mooltan grant to such absurdities, we see little
to exalt them in the scale of reasonable beings;
but it seems inherent in the people to propagate
and uphold such delusions, for there are tales
equally improbable regarding every tomb in the
city. Rookn-i-alum, the son of Bhawul Huq,
removed to his present sepulchre when dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion of
the Seiks.</div>

<p>At Mooltan we first saw the practice of
religion amongst the Seiks. In a veranda of
the tomb of Shumsi-Tabreezee, a “Gooroo,”
or priest of that persuasion, had taken up his
abode since the conquest of the city. We
found him seated on the ground, with a huge
volume in front of him; and a place covered
with cloth, like an altar, at one end of the apartment:
he opened the book at my request, and
repeating the words “wa gooroojee ka futteh,”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
touched the volume with his forehead, and all
the Seiks in attendance immediately bowed to
the ground: he then read and explained the
first passage that he turned up, which was as fol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>lows&mdash;“All
of you have sinned; endeavour
therefore to purify yourselves: if you neglect
the caution, evil will at last overtake you.” I
need hardly mention that the volume was the
“Grinth,” or holy book of the Seiks: their reverence
for it amounts to veneration, and the
priest waves a “<i>choury</i>,” or a Tibet cow’s tail,
over it, as if he were fanning an emperor. The
Gooroo was free from pomp and pride, and gave
a willing explanation to our enquiries: he opened
his holy book to acknowledge the gift of a few
rupees, that I made in due form, and requested
my acceptance of some confections in return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intolerance.</div>

<p>The presence of a Seik priest, and the paraphernalia
of his order, under the roof of a
Mahommedan tomb, will furnish a good commentary
on the state of that religion in this
country; it is barely tolerated. In this city,
which held for upwards of 800 years, so high
a Mahommedan supremacy, there is now no
public “<i>numaz</i>;” the true believer dare not lift
his voice in public. The “<i>Eeds</i>” and the
Mohurum pass without the usual observances;
the “<i>Ullaho Acbar</i>” of the priest is never
heard; the mosques are yet frequented, but the
pious are reduced to offering up their orisons in
silence. Such has been the state of things since
Mooltan fell, in 1818, and yet the number of
Seiks is confined to that of the garrison, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
four to five hundred men. The Mahommedans,
who amount to about 40,000 souls, suffer no
other inconvenience from their new masters,
who afford every protection to their trade. The
Seiks excuse themselves, by alleging, that they
have not inflicted, in retribution, one fourth of
their own sufferings at the hands of the Mahommedans.
They are, I believe, correct in the
averment, but religious persecution, is always
revolting, and exercises a baneful influence in
every age and country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Climate.</div>

<p>The climate of Mooltan differs from that of
the countries lower down the Indus; showers
of rain are common at all seasons, and yet the
dust is intolerable. For nine successive evenings,
we had a tornado of it from the westward, with
lightning, and distant thunder. Such storms are
said to be frequent; they appear to set in from
the Sooliman mountains, between which and the
Indus the sand or dust is raised. The heat and
dust of Mooltan have grown into a proverb, to
which have been added, not unmeritedly, the
prevalence of beggars, and the number of the
tombs, in the following Persian <span class="lock">couplet:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Chuhar cheez hust, toohfujat-i-Mooltan.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gird, guda, gurma wu goristan.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As far as I could judge, the satire is just: the
dust darkened the sun: the thermometer rose in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
June to 100° of Fahrenheit, in a bungalow artificially
cooled: the beggars hunted us every where;
and we trod on the cemeteries of the dead, in
whatever direction we rode.</p>

<p>The country around Mooltan is highly cultivated;
the Acesines sends the water of its
inundation to the very walls of the city, and
there is a large canal, that extends it, at other
seasons, through Mooltan itself. The plain that
intervenes between the river and city has the
appearance of a rich meadow, and is overgrown
with date trees, which form here a productive
source of revenue. It is a popular belief in the
country, that this tree was introduced from
Arabia by the army of Mahommed-bin-Cassim,
who brought the fruit as a provision for his army.
It is a curious fact that they are principally
found in the track of that invader, who marched
from Alore to Mooltan. If the tradition be
true, the destroying Moslem compensated in
some degree for the evils and scourge of his
inroad. There are many ruined hamlets around
Mooltan, the remains of Jagheers, held by the
Afghans, but though these are deserted their
inhabitants have only changed their residence,
and occupy houses in the city.</p>

<p>We removed our camp on the 20th to the
banks of the Acesines, which is four miles
distant. The river is about 650 yards wide,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
but at the ferry itself, it is expanded to 1000
at this season. We here found ten boats,
laden with mineral salt, from Pind Dadun
Khan; they exceeded eighty feet in length.
These boats drop down to Mooltan in twelve
days, from the mines, when fully laden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quit Mooltan.</div>

<p>We embarked on the 21st of June, on a boat
which the Maharajah had fitted up for our reception
with two wooden bungalows; and,
along with the rest of our fleet, prosecuted our
voyage. We did not again exchange our boats,
in the way to Lahore.


<span class="sidenote">Desert.</span>
On quitting the ferry at
Mooltan, we came in sight of the desert that lies
between the Chenab and the Indus. It does
not commence so low as Ooch, as has been represented
in our maps, but near the latitude of
Mooltan, and runs parallel with the river, at
a distance of about two miles, leaving a stripe of
cultivated land. The sand-hills resemble those
of the sea shore, and have a scanty covering of
bushes, I cannot call it verdure: they do not
exceed twenty feet in elevation, but from refraction
often appeared much higher. There is a
great contrast between the sterile tract, and the
champaign plains of the eastern bank, which we
found every where irrigated. The villages lie at
a distance of about two miles from the river, and
have their fields fertilised from canals, by the
Persian wheel. On the banks of the Indus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
wells are common, but on the Chenab they are
only to be seen on the verge of canals that
branch from it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peeloo.</div>

<p>There is a shrub called “peeloo<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>,” which is
to be found in this neighbourhood, and in all
tracts of saline soil that border on the Indus
and Punjab Rivers. It produces a red and white
berry, which has but a poor flavour; the taste of
its seeds resembles watercresses: this is the season
of the fruit, and it was exposed for sale in the
bazars of Mooltan. I observed this shrub in
greatest abundance in the delta, and lower parts
of Sinde; and, as I am satisfied that it is only
to be found in the particular soil described,
I believe we recognise it in Arrian’s Indian
History. “The leaves resemble those of the
laurel; they grow <i>chiefly</i> in places where the
tide flows among them, and where they are
again left dry at low water. Their flower is
white, and in shape like a violet, but much excelling
it in sweetness.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seik government.</div>

<p>The arrangements made for our progress
through the Seik territories were very complete.
We sailed from sunrise to sunset; and found
thirty or forty villagers alongside by day-break
to drag each boat. The fatigue and exertion
which these people underwent in a hot sun was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
excessive. When they passed a field of melons,
but few were left to the owner; and many an
old lady scolded loudly as they invaded her
property. The people of this country are treated
with little consideration by the government;
they are not oppressed, yet considered its servants
since the conquest. But for our interference,
these villagers, who had waded through the
water and quicksands, would have been dismissed
empty-handed at night. The bounty of
the Maharajah enabled us daily to entertain
sumptuously, with flour and ghee, 300 hungry
villagers; and the Mihmandar further assured
me that due remission would be made for the
destruction of the fields in our progress. While
we ourselves advanced by water, the elephants,
camels, and escort seconded our motions on
shore; and we always found them drawn up
in parade array on the ground fixed for our
night’s encampment; we always slept on shore.
Before dusk we rode out on elephants to the
neighbouring villages, and conversed with the
people. They are lamentably ignorant; and
consisted chiefly of Juts, a tribe of Mahommedans
engaged in agriculture. They are not allowed
to pray aloud; but they stimulated each other
when pressed in our service by loud shouts and
invocations to Bhawul Huq, the revered saint
of Mooltan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alexander.</div>

<p>As the sun set on the 23d, we moored below
the village of Fazil Shah, in the mouth of the
Ravee or Hydraotes, still called Iräotee by the
natives. This was the spot where Alexander of
Macedon met his anxious army after his severe
wound, and showed to his troops that his precious
life was yet preserved: but these are events which
live only in the historical works of Europe; they
are unknown to the natives of Asia. I must
mention, however, a circumstance corroborative
of the Greek historians,&mdash;the fields of beans
that I observed on the banks of this river. They
led Alexander, for some time, to mistake the
heads of the Indus for the Nile; and now
remain, in a distant age, as proofs of his journey,
and accuracy in the historians of his expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gifts from
Lahore.</div>

<p>The intelligence of our arrival in the country
of the Seiks soon reached Lahore; and a pair
of gold armlets, set with diamonds and emeralds,
arrived in due course as a gift from the Maharajah
to our Mihmandar. The Lahore chief is
munificent in his distribution of presents among
his nobles, though less so than in former years.
Grants of land, and gifts of jewels and money,
are yet made. They attest the wealth of the
country, and the sound policy of the prince.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enter the
Ravee.</div>

<p>On the 24th we quitted the Acesines, and
entered on the navigation of the Ravee. At the
point of union, the former river has a breadth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
three quarters of a mile, though the deep part
does not extend for 500 yards.</p>

<p>Lieut. Macartney makes mention of a report
which he had heard of the Chenab being fordable
in the cold season below this point; but the
natives assured me, that such an occurrence had
never happened in the memory of man, and I
found the soundings to exceed twelve feet. The
Chenab, indeed, is only inferior to the Indus;
its current is more rapid than that river, and,
with its depressed banks, it yet preserves every
where a depth of two fathoms. The Ravee
throws itself into the Chenab by three mouths,
close to each other. This river is very small,
and resembles a canal, rarely exceeding 150 yards
in breadth in any part of its course. Its banks
are precipitous, so that it deepens before it expands.
Nothing can exceed the crookedness
of its course, which is a great impediment to
navigation, for we often found ourselves, after
half a day’s sail, within two miles of the spot
from which we started. The water of the Ravee
is redder than that of the Chenab. It is fordable
in most places for eight months of the year. Its
banks are overgrown with reeds and tamarisk,
and for half the distance, from its estuary to the
capital, there is no cultivation. There are no
canals or cuts from this river below Lahore.
There is a very extensive one above that city,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
which I shall have occasion to mention hereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tolumba.</div>

<p>On the 27th of June we reached the small
town of Tolumba, which is situated in a grove
of date trees, nearly three miles south of the
Ravee. Sheriffo Deen, the historian of Timour,
informs us that that conqueror crossed the
Ravee at Tolumba on his route to Delhi, so
that we now found ourselves on the track of
another invader.</p>

<p>The Tartar is yet remembered by his offerings
at the shrines in this neighbourhood. Below
the town, the Ravee assumes a straight course
for twelve miles, and presents a vista of beautiful
scenery, as the banks are fringed with lofty
trees, that overhang the river. The natives
attribute this peculiarity in the Ravee to divine
influence. The clothes of a saint, when bathing,
were washed into the stream, and the eyes of
the holy man, when turned in search of them,
straightened the river!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit to the
Hydaspes.</div>

<p>The Hydaspes was now at hand, the spot
where it unites with the Acesines was only forty-five
miles distant: here the fleet of Alexander
encountered its disasters in the rapids, and the
hordes of Timour were terrified by the noise of
the waters. Much to the surprise of our Seik
friends, who could not comprehend the motives
of our curiosity, we set out on a galloping ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>pedition
for the scene of these memorable events,
and found ourselves on the second evening on
the banks of the Hydaspes. Our anxiety to behold
the “fabulous Hydaspes” was heightened
by the belief, that this spot, so famous in its
ancient history, had never been visited by an
European since the days of the Greeks. The
river joins the Acesines with a murmuring noise,
but the velocity of the current is inconsiderable,
and vessels pass it without danger, except in
July and August. There are no eddies or rocks,
nor is the channel confined, but the ancient
character is supported by the noise of the confluence,
which is greater than that of any of the
other rivers.</p>

<p>The boatmen at the ferry said, that, during
the swell of the river, they placed themselves
under the protection of a saint, whose tomb
stands at the fork of the two rivers. The superstitious
reliance bespeaks danger. We stood on
the verge of the river, talking with the people,
till the sun set in the desert westward of us;
our Seik companions in the mean time, bathing
in the stream; for, if deprived of the enjoyment
which we derived, they had a compensation
in the belief of performing ablutions
at a holy spot, the junction of one river with
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hydaspes.</div>

<p>This river is named Behut or Bedusta, also Jelum,
by the people on its banks, and falls into the
Acesines or Chenab in the latitude of 31° 11´ 30´´,
forty-five miles north of the town of Tolumba,
on the Ravee. The banks of the Hydaspes
coincide but faintly with the description of Arrian:
they do not confine the river in a narrow
channel, nor are there rocks anywhere near to
mark the spot where the Greeks retired with
their dismantled fleet. The name of Hydaspes
is yet discoverable in the modern appellation of
Bedusta. The Hydaspes is less rapid, and altogether
a smaller stream than the Acesines, being
about 500 yards in breadth at the point of conflux;
when joined, these rivers roll on for a
short distance in a channel full a mile in breadth,
and about twelve feet deep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boats of
the Greeks.</div>

<p>The timber of which the boats of the Punjab
are constructed is chiefly floated down by the
Hydaspes from the Indian Caucasus, which most
satisfactorily explains the selection of its banks
as the site of a naval arsenal by Alexander in
preference to the other rivers, by any of which
he might have reached the Indus without a
retrograde movement. There are but few boats
on this river: about fifty are used in the salt
trade at Pind Dadun Khan, some of which
carry 500 maunds of salt, and exceed 100 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
in length, being built like the “Zohruq,”
rounded at both ends. They do not hoist a
sail, and often pass the conflux in safety. We
are informed that the war-ships of the Greeks
encountered the greatest difficulties in the navigation
of this river, and are naturally led to
attribute the calamities of some of them to the
build, since the provision boats, which are described
as of “a round form;” and, I presume,
like the “Zohruq,” escaped uninjured. That
Alexander built the greatest part of his own
fleet, is certain, for he commenced his voyage
on the Hydaspes with 800 vessels; and when
he first reached that stream he was entirely
destitute of them; so that he ordered the boats
by which he passed the Indus to be broken up
and brought by land across the Doab. We
hear likewise of triremes and biremes, that in no
way correspond with the present description of
boats on the Indus; from which it is probable
that the round boats which escaped uninjured
were country vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Passage of
the Hydaspes.</div>

<p>The Hydaspes and Acesines have been forded
in the cold season; but when joined they have
never been passed but by boats. Timour, in
his expedition to Delhi, threw a bridge across
the conflux at Trimo ferry. Runjeet Singh
swam the Hydaspes at Sahewal with a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
body of horse; but that enterprising chief has
crossed the Indus itself above Attok in the
same manner. The merchants from Khorasan
travel to India at all seasons, taking the route
by Dera Ismael Khan, Mankere, and the Sandy
Desert, crossing at Trimo, on the road to
Toolumba. The country between these last two
places differs from the right bank of the Hydaspes:
destitute of sand hills, it is almost as
barren and desert. A sheet of hard clay, with
clumps of tamarisk, <i>khair</i>, <i>lan</i>, <i>kejra</i>, and such
other shrubs as are to be found in the Thurr, or
Desert of India, extends from the Chenab to
the Ravee. There is not a blade of grass but
on the banks of the rivers. Water is procurable
from wells about thirty feet deep, but is scarce,
and always fetid and noxious, though rarely
salt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cathæi of
Arrian.</div>

<p>The population chiefly consists of the pastoral
tribe of Kattia, or Jun, who are so called from
their living an erratic life, “Jun” having that
signification: few of them are found at any
distance from the rivers but in the rainy season.
They have immense herds of buffaloes and
camels, from the milk of which they derive
sustenance; hardly cultivating the soil, though
some tolerable fields of tobacco, raised by irrigation,
may be seen near their habitations.
They are a tall and handsome race; which may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
be attributed to a rule among them, prohibiting
marriages before their females attain the age
of twenty years: they believe that the children
of an early union, so common among every
other Indian tribe, are puny and unhealthy.
These Kattia are a predatory and warlike race:
few of them are free from scars and wounds.
They extend from the banks of the Hydaspes
across the deserts to Delhi, and are the aborigines
of this country, in whom, I think, we
recognise the Cathæi of Arrian; as he calls
them “a stout people, well skilled in military
affairs.” I am aware that these people have
been supposed to be the Kuttrees or Rajpoots;
but their country is further to the south, and
did not occupy this part of India on the Greek
invasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ruins of
Shorkote.</div>

<p>In the space which intervenes between the
Hydaspes and Ravee, and about equidistant
from either river, stand the ruins of Shorkote,
near a small town of that name. They occupy
a considerable space, being much larger than
Sehwun, and of the same description; viz., a
mound of earth, surrounded by a brick wall,
and so high as to be seen for a circuit of six or
eight miles. The traditions of the people state
that a Hindoo Rajah of the name of Shor ruled
in this city, and was attacked by a king from
“Wulayut,” or the countries westward, about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
1300 years ago, and overcome through supernatural
means. Shorkote is mentioned by
Timour’s historian; and its locality leads me to
fix on it as the place where Alexander received
his wound, for he crossed to the west bank of
the Hydraotes in pursuit of the Malli, who had
retired to “a fortified city not far off,” the
walls of which were of brick. The story of
the King of the West is, to say the least of it,
a very probable tradition of Alexander of Macedon.
The construction of the place throws
some light on the fortresses which were captured
by Alexander. Ancient cities on the Indus
appear to have been mounds of earth surrounded
by brick walls. At Shorcote I had
the good fortune to procure a variety of coins,
which I long believed to be Hindoo; but my
surmise regarding the antiquity of the spot
received a strong and satisfactory confirmation
through the intelligence of the able secretary
to the Asiatic Society of Bengal,&mdash;Mr. James
Prinsep. That gentlemen discovered it to be a
Bactrian coin, resembling that of an Appolodotus,
and shaped like a Menander,&mdash;two coins of the
Bactrian monarchs, found by Colonel J. Tod,
and engraved in the transactions of the Royal
Asiatic Society. The Greek word Bazileos
may be read; and I had, therefore, to congratulate
myself on having, in my journey to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the Hydaspes, found the first Grecian relic in
the Punjab.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return to
the Ravee.</div>

<p>We retraced our steps from this famous river,
and saw much of the Kattia, or Jun tribe. They
were greatly surprised by our visit, and approached
in crowds to see us. They live in
scattered villages, and move their houses from
place to place. Both men and women were tall
and stout, with sun-burnt complexions. The
men allow their hair to grow in loose tresses
over their shoulders: the women have ear-rings
of an enormous size; but the stout and sturdy
dames appeared not the least incumbered from
their weight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Birds and
reptiles of
the Ravee.</div>

<p>We returned to Toolumba on the 1st of July,
jaded from the excessive heat, but highly gratified
with our journey. We immediately embarked,
and prosecuted our voyage. During our absence
the river had risen two feet, from a fall of
rain in the mountains; but it did not appear
much wider. We saw more aquatic birds in
the Ravee than in our whole voyage; they consisted
of cranes, storks, pelicans, ducks, teal, &amp;c.
Among the inhabitants of the river itself, a
creature called “bolun” was the most remarkable.
We saw several of them in the mouth of
the Ravee, which were of a black colour, and
rolled like the porpoise. The natives class this
fish with the alligator, and say it has four small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
paws, and a long snout like a pig. Its habits
do not lead it on shore, and it lives on small
fish. The large alligator is unknown here; but
the long-nosed reptile called “ghuryal” abounds.
There is said to be a singular creature, called
“thundwa,” in this river, which is described as
of the turtle species, and to have a string in its
mouth, by which it can entangle a man, or even
an elephant. It is mentioned in the Shasters
as having seized the elephant of a god. I have
not seen the “thundwa,” nor do I believe the
story of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Table
supplies.</div>

<p>Though we had journeyed thus far in the
country of the Seiks, we had not passed a village
inhabited by them, or seen any others of the
tribe than were attached to our suite. The
country is very poorly peopled, and without
tillage for many miles. The means taken to
supply our wants in the voyage often excited a
smile. Every villager in office had been addressed,
and a list of articles which are edible
to the “Firingees” ordered to be collected.
Baskets of eggs, kept for weeks in expectation
of our arrival, were daily brought to us, sometimes
to the number of 400 or 500; but they
were better adapted for the punishment of a
malefactor in the pillory than the table, and, in
a few, chickens were to be found in the shell!
Butchers were brought from Mooltan to supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
our wants: loads of saltpetre were daily sent
to cool the wine and water, and the necessaries
and luxuries of life were supplied without
bounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heat.</div>

<p>The heat now became oppressive, and gave
indication of the monsoon, according to the
natives. In the afternoon of the 3d of July we
had the thermometer so high as 110° at 4 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>;
and at sunset a storm set in from the north-west,
which was really sublime. Clouds appeared to
approach us for about half an hour, gradually
rising from the horizon, and looking more like
mountains in motion. When it came upon us,
we found it to be one of those tornadoes that
we experienced near Mooltan, and unaccompanied
by rain. The wind was hot and sultry,
and bore clouds of fine dust along with it. It
passed over in an hour, and was succeeded by
vivid flashes of lightning from the same quarter.
Six days after the phenomenon the rain set in
with great violence; and till then we had a continuance
of the dust every evening.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of
an elephant.</div>

<p>Our Mihmandar waited on us at the village
of Cheechawutnee with an enormous elephant,
and said that he had been instructed by the
Maharaja to place it at our disposal, as he feared
the native houda did not suit our taste: he was
right in his conjectures, and we appreciated the
civility. The animal was richly caparisoned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
and bore a large chair, ornamented with silver
and enamel work, lined with red velvet. He
was accompanied by six of the Maharaja’s own
Orderlies, in dresses of scarlet faced with yellow,
which had a good appearance. The Seiks, in
all the various military costumes that they have
adopted, never lay aside the small turban of
their tribe; which, I must say, becomes them.</p>

<p>It was a source of no small amusement to
watch the love of gossip among the natives of
our suite. We had a reporter sent purposely
from the Court, who daily despatched an account
of our employment and rides: the news-writer
of Mooltan followed us from that city, and every
day transmitted a Gazette; I had also letters from
the news-writer at Lahore, giving me a <i>précis</i> of
local news, and asking for a <i>morceau</i> in return.
Our Dewan corresponded with the Chevaliers
Ventura and Allard; and I was somewhat surprized
to receive answers to many of my enquiries
regarding the country from the former
gentleman, to whom their subject had been communicated
without my knowledge. Nothing,
however, could exceed the politeness of all the
people towards us; and the ready and happy
manner they acceded to our wishes made us
careful to wish for any thing. As may be supposed,
there were no bounds to their flattery;
and we were daily informed that we were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
“second Alexander,” the “Sikunder sanee,”
for having achieved so dangerous a voyage as the
Indus. The polite natives of this quarter view
with dread the barbarity and customs of Sindees
and Beloochees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ruins of
Harapa.</div>

<p>About fifty miles eastward of Toolumba, I
passed inland for four miles to examine the
ruins of an ancient city, called Harapa. The
remains are extensive, and the place, which
has been built of brick, is about three miles in
circumference. There is a ruined citadel on the
river side of the town; but otherwise Harapa is
a perfect chaos, and has not an entire building:
the bricks have been removed to build a small
place of the old name hard by. Tradition fixes
the fall of Harapa at the same period as Shorkote
(1300 years ago), and the people ascribe its ruin
to the vengeance of God on Harapa, its governor,
who claimed certain privileges on the
marriage of every couple in his city, and in
the course of his sensualities, was guilty of incest.
At a later period, Harapa became a Mahommedan
town; and there is a tomb of a Saint
of the “faithful,” eighteen feet in length, the
assigned, but fabulous, stature of the deceased.
A large stone of annular form, and a huge black
slab of an oval shape, which lie near the grave,
are said to represent the ring and its gem of this
departed giant, and to have been converted from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
more valuable to their present base materials.
Where such fables are believed, we must cease
to hope for even reasonable fiction. I found
some coins in these ruins, both Persian and
Hindoo, but I cannot fix its era from any of
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The inhabitants.</div>

<p>As we ascended the Ravee, and cleared the
country of the Kattias, the population increased,
and their hamlets, though small, were numerous.
Crowds of people flocked to the banks of the
river as we approached, and evinced the most
intense curiosity to see us. One man would
call out that he was a Syud, another that he
was a Zemindar, a third that he was a Peer, or
Saint, and a fourth, that he was a Seik; while
the ladies themselves were not backward in expressing
their anxiety for a sight of us. On such
occasions we always moved out of our cabin, or
bungalow; but this ready exhibition only attracted
another concourse of spectators. The
notions which they entertained of us were most
extravagant: we were believed to be under the
guardian care of two pigeons, who shaded us
from the sun and rain. One individual asked
us seriously to impart to him the secret of converting
shreds of onions into gold ducats, which
he had understood we had been practising!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A tiger
hunt.</div>

<p>The bravery of our Seik friends had been
already exhibited to us by their attacking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
wild hog with a sword, on foot; but a nobler
specimen of their courage was displayed in the
death of a tiger. We disturbed the animal in a
thicket of tamarisk close to our boats; and the
Mihmandar immediately invited us to see the
sport. Mr. Leckie accompanied the party; but
our elephant was not at hand, and I did not go.
The party was entirely composed of horsemen.
The monster was speedily wounded by some one,
and several riders were unhorsed from the fright
of their steeds. The Seiks then advanced on
foot, sword in hand, to attack the tiger: he
sprang at one man most furiously; and, as he
fixed on his left shoulder, the poor fellow bravely
struck his head by a well-directed blow: the
contest was unequal, and the man fell, horribly
lacerated. His comrades instantly ran up, and,
with cuts and wounds, the tiger soon fell. He
was a huge animal, and measured ten feet:
his thigh was as large as that of a full-grown
man. The coolness and courage of the Seiks
surpass belief; they have great encouragement
from their chiefs. To all my enquiries regarding
the unfortunate man that had been
wounded, they replied, with an ostentation of
indifference, that he was but a Seik, would
be well rewarded, and had already received a
horse, and his annual pay had been increased an
hundred rupees. The skin, head, and paws of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the tiger were immediately despatched to the
Maharaja, whose bounty will be further extended
to the wounded. This encouragement makes
these people the bravest of the Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strange
treatment.</div>

<p>The faculty will be surprised at the Seik
mode of curing a wound received from a tiger,
at variance as it is with European practices.
They entertain an opinion that, if a person
who has been so wounded be allowed to sleep,
he will see the tiger in his dreams, and thus
lose his heart, and inevitably die. They therefore
furnish the patient with the strongest stimulants,
and set people to prevent his falling asleep for
five or six days. By that time the wounds assume
a certain appearance; and they then permit
the man to rest. In the instance which I have
mentioned, I can answer for the copious use of
stimulants, as we supplied the brandy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intelligence
of a
Seik.</div>

<p>The intelligence of the Seik Sirdar Senu Sing,
our Mihmandar, had, more than once, arrested
my attention. From a perusal of translations,
he had acquired some knowledge of our astronomical
system, and of the astrolabe, with
several other such instruments. He expressed
his doubts on some parts of the theory; and
asked me to explain the continuance of the pole
star in one place when the earth was said to
move so many miles daily in its orbit round the
sun. Among other information that I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
enabled to impart to him, I showed him the
thermometer, and explained the nature of the
instrument. He immediately had the whole
particulars committed to writing: and, where
such avidity, and so laudable a thirst for knowledge,
were displayed, I could not withhold
making him a present of the instrument. This
Sirdar was equally expert in the martial exercises
of his nation: he handled the bow with
grace and dexterity; he was an excellent horseman,
and could hit a mark at full speed; and I
have seen him touch the ground with both feet
at the gallop, and regain his seat. I must
mention that his curiosity did not always take a
scientific turn; for his wonder had been excited
by our art in preserving meat, fish, &amp;c. A ham,
which I showed him, was calculated to satisfy
his doubts; and he was only contented when he
had got a complete recipe for curing it. The
Seiks are very fond of hog; and ham bids fair
to be a standing dish in the Punjab. By the
11th of July we had left the country of the
Kattias, and reached Futtihpoor, where the
land is cultivated. Our approach to Lahore
seemed to facilitate every arrangement: a detachment
of fifty lancers had been stationed in
the intervening villages, to assemble the inhabitants,
to drag the boats the moment we approached.
Our own suite was now increased to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
about 500 people; and to a drum and fife,
which had always been with us, a bugle was
added. Such dissonance as was now produced
was never heard “at tattoo or reveille o;” and
they played at both hours.


<span class="sidenote">A Cashmere
boat.</span>
We had also a
Cashmere boat sent for our accommodation,
called the “purinda” or bird. It was a complete
skiff, about sixty feet long, and pointed at
both ends, so that half of the boat did not even
touch the water. I am informed that this style
of build, not unlike the gondola of Venice, is
general in the lake of Cashmere. The crew were
natives of that country; and they impelled their
vessel by small green-painted paddles, with which
they struck the water in a peculiar manner.
They were very handsome and athletic men,
dressed in red jackets. The boat itself had a
square bungalow in the centre, with a flat roof;
where we sat during the cool of the evening.
She was flat-bottomed; and had her planks
clamped with iron. Her motion through the
water was tremulous, and by no means agreeable;
but the celerity with which vessels of this
kind move is acknowledged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter from
Lahore.</div>

<p>On the 13th of July, a deputation from the
Kardar of Kot Kamalia waited on us with presents
of fruit, &amp;c., and a sum of 1100 rupees.
A letter was brought, at the same time, from
the Maharaja, expressive of his great satisfaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
at our approach. The epistle was flowery to a
degree seldom met with even in the Persian
language; and filled with similes about gardens,
roses, zephyrs, and fountains. Every word of a
letter which I had addressed to his Highness
was declared to be a bud of everlasting friendship;
and every letter of every word was a
blown rose! But the document would require
a translation, and that, perhaps, it does not
deserve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
wars of the
Seiks.</div>

<p>Neither the congratulations nor munificence
of the Maharaja could keep our people well:
they were attacked with whitlow; and there
were no less than seven or eight of them laid up
at once with that painful complaint. They
themselves ascribed it to the water; but I was
rather disposed to attribute it to a want of it and
exercise; for they had had a voyage of longer
duration than a trip from India to England.
We now entered the country of the Seiks. All
these people are either soldiers or husbandmen,
like the Romans of old. They were very
communicative; and described with much ardour
the campaigns in which they have fought,
and their collision with the bigoted Euzoofzyes
across the Indus. I should hardly expect to
be credited if I recorded many of the circumstances
that have been communicated to me,
and the number of people that have fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
in these religious wars. The Euzoofzyes entertain
such hatred for the infidel Seiks, that they often
declare themselves “ghazee,” and devote their
lives to their extinction; believing that the death
of one of them is more meritorious than that of
any other unbeliever. As the Seik religion arose
some hundred years after Mahommed, they are
not certainly supported by their prophet. To
use an expression of the Seiks, the Euzoofzyes
“laugh at death.” It has been justly remarked,
that we know little and care less for the history
of such transactions, when we have no connection
with the parties concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deputation.</div>

<p>In the evening of the 15th we reached Changa,
about twenty-five miles from Lahore, and were
received by a deputation from the Maharaja, consisting
of two Seik Sirdars, and Noorodeen
Fakeer, of a Mahommedan family enjoying
trust and influence at Court. The meeting, as
was requested, took place on elephants, five of
which bore the magnates and ourselves. Each
individual delivered a purse of money in gold
and silver, and, by his Highness’ desire, asked
for the health of the King of England, and the
period that had elapsed since we left London:
for the Maharaja, it seemed, believed us to have
been deputed from the royal footstool. I replied
as circumstances required. The principal
Seik, by name Sham Sing, presented a bow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
The party also produced a letter from the Maharaja,
mentioning that they had been instructed
to congratulate us on our arrival, and use every
expression which could be pleasing to the sense;
and a tissue of flattery ensued, which I confess
my inability to describe.</p>

<p>“The seasons,” said the Fakeer, “have
been changed to aid your safe arrival; and
when it should have rained, the sun shines; but
it is the sun of England. You must now consider
yourselves at home, and in a garden, of
which you are the roses; that such a friendship
had now grown up between the British
and the Seiks, that the inhabitants of Iran and
Room would hear it proclaimed in their distant
dominions; that light had succeeded darkness
when we merged from the barbarians of Sinde,
and that its genial influence had changed the
bud into the rose.” I should exhaust a vocabulary
if I recorded all his expressions. I
replied as well as I could in the same style, asking
after the Maharaja’s health; and assured the
deputation of our satisfaction at the kindness
and attention which we had received in the Seik
dominions. Before taking leave, I showed the
party the horses, with which they were delighted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Escort.</div>

<p>The Sirdars brought an escort of lancers and
Seik cavalry: the latter party were entirely
dressed in yellow, and had just returned with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Sham Sing from the campaign against Syud
Ahmed, who had long carried on a fanatical war
in this country, and had been lately killed.</p>

<p>Among the party, a boy was pointed out, who
had been nominated to the command held by his
fallen father,&mdash;a Seik rule admirably calculated
to feed the military spirit of their nation. We
rode among them, evidently much to their delight,
and to our own amusement. The chiefs
wore many valuable jewels; but these ornaments
did not become the wrists and brows of such
warriors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seik ladies.</div>

<p>We had now an opportunity of seeing the
Seik ladies, who are not less peculiar in their
appearance than their husbands. They knot the
hair at the crown, and throw a white robe over
it, which entirely envelopes the body, and gives
a conical shape to the head. They pull up the
hair so tight to form this knot, that the skin of
the forehead is drawn with it, and the eyebrows
are considerably removed from the visual organ.
As may be imagined, this fashion does not improve
their personal appearance, yet it is general
among all classes of the females. The Seik ladies
are not so handsome as their husbands; their
features are sharp and regular. They are not
confined to their houses as strictly as the Mahommedan
women; for the Seiks, in matrimony
as well as religion, differ widely from the
followers of the Prophet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></p>

<p>In the evening of the 16th, we had a second
visit from the deputation of yesterday, who
brought us a sum of 700 rupees, with an announcement
from the Maharaja that that amount
had been fixed on as our daily allowance during
our further stay in the Punjab. I accepted the
sum, but did not consider it proper to allow of
such wasteful munificence being in future continued.</p>

<p>At noon, on the 17th of July, we came in
sight of the lofty minarets of the King’s mosque
at Lahore, and might have reached the ancient
capital of the Moghul empire, and the termination
of our protracted voyage; but the ceremonial of
our <i>entrée</i> required arrangement, and we halted
three or four miles from the city, at the earnest
request of our conductors. As the sun set, I
saw, for the first time, the massy mountains
which encircle Cashmere, clothed in a mantle of
white snow. I felt a nervous sensation of joy as
I first gazed on the Himalaya, and almost forgot
the duties I owed to our conductors, in contemplating
these mighty works of nature.</p>

<span class="smaller">LAHORE.</span></h2>

</div>


<div class="sidenote">Enter
Lahore.</div>

<p>On the morning of the 18th of June we made
our public entrance into Lahore. The Maharaja’s
minister, Uzeez-o-Deen, and Raja Ghoolab
Sing, with the principal men of the state, met
us at a distance of three miles from the city,
escorted by a guard of cavalry and a regiment
of infantry. We were introduced to these personages
by Captain Wade, the political agent of
government at Lodiana, who had been deputed
to Lahore on the occasion, and was accompanied
by Dr. A. Murray. The sight of these gentlemen,
after our long absence from European society,
excited the most pleasurable feelings. Our
reception was also most gratifying, heightened,
as it was, by the reflection that our undertaking
had been this day brought to a safe and
successful issue. We alighted at a garden about
a mile from Lahore, the residence of M. Chevalier
Allard, whose manners and address were
engaging and gentlemanlike. We here parted
with the deputation, after receiving a large sum
of money and a profusion of sweetmeats in the
name of the Maharaja.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<p>The Chevalier then conducted us to an upper
room, where we sat down to a <i>déjeûné à la
fourchette</i> of the richest cookery.</p>

<p>Another French gentleman, M. Court, was
of our party. The scene was novel to us: the
walls and roof of the apartment were entirely
inlaid with small pieces of mirror. Champagne
usurped the place of tea and coffee. M. Allard
is the Maharaja’s General of cavalry; and we had
the trumpets of his division in attendance during
breakfast. We continued with our worthy host
during the following day, which passed in preparations
for our introduction at Court, which
had been fixed for the 20th instant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Presentation
at
Court.</div>

<p>About 9 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, when the Maharaja had reached
the ancient palace that stands within the walls
of Lahore, he sent a deputation of his nobles
to conduct us to Court. All the Sirdars and
officers who had been from time to time sent
to us were previously in attendance, besides a
numerous escort; and the pageant was further
swelled by a detachment of Bengal sepoys which
Captain Wade had brought from Lodiana. The
coach, which was a handsome vehicle, headed
the procession; and in rear of the dray-horses
we ourselves followed on elephants, with the
officers of the Maharaja. We passed close under
the walls of the city, between them and the
ditch, and entered Lahore by the palace gate.
The streets were lined with cavalry, artillery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
and infantry, all of which saluted as we passed.
The concourse of people was immense; they
had principally seated themselves on the balconies
of the houses, and preserved a most respectful
silence. On entering the first court of
the palace, we were received by Raja Dihan
Sing, a fine soldierlike looking person, dressed
in armour, by whom we were conducted to the
door of the palace. While stooping to remove
my shoes at the threshold, I suddenly found
myself in the arms and tight embrace of a diminutive
old-looking man,&mdash;the great Maharaja
Runjeet Sing. He was accompanied by two of
his sons, who likewise embraced Mr. Leckie and
myself; when the Maharaja conducted me by
the hand to the interior of his court; our
reception was of the most distinguished nature,
and he had advanced that distance to
do us honour. We found Captain Wade and
Dr. Murray in the Durbar, and all of us were
seated on silver chairs, in front of his Highness.
The Maharaja made various complimentary remarks;
asked particularly after the health of
his Majesty the King of Great Britain; and,
as we had come from Bombay, enquired for
Sir John Malcolm. When we had been seated
a short time, I informed his Highness that I
had brought along with me in safety to Lahore
five horses, which his most gracious Majesty
the King of England had conferred upon him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
in consideration of the relations of amity and
concord subsisting between the states; as also
a carriage from the Right Honourable the
Governor-general of India, in token of his
Lordship’s esteem. I then added, that the
horses were accompanied by a most friendly
letter from his Majesty’s minister for the affairs
of India, which I held in my hand in a
bag of cloth of gold, sealed with the arms
of England. On this the Maharaja and his
Court, as well as ourselves, rose up, and his
Highness received the letter, and touched his
forehead with the seal. The letter was then
handed to his minister, Uzeez-o-Deen, who read
a Persian translation of it in the presence of the
whole Court. The envoys from the surrounding
states were present. The following is a copy
of the communication with which his Majesty
had honoured the ruler of <span class="lock">Lahore:&mdash;</span></p>

of the Seik Nation, and Lord of Cashmere.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maharaja</span>,</p>

<p>The King, my most gracious master, has
commanded me to express to your Highness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
his Majesty’s acknowledgments of your Highness’s
attention in transmitting to his Majesty,
by the esteemed and excellent Lord, Earl, Amherst,
the splendid manufacture of your Highness’s
subjects of Cashmere.</p>

<p>The King, knowing that your Highness is in
possession of the most beautiful horses of the
most celebrated breeds of Asia, has thought that
it might be agreeable to your Highness to possess
some horses of the most remarkable breed
of Europe; and, in the wish to gratify your
Highness in this matter, has commanded me to
select for your Highness some horses of the
gigantic breed which is peculiar to England.</p>

<p>These horses, selected with care requiring
much time, I now send to your Highness; and
as their great weight makes it inexpedient that
they should undergo the fatigue of a long march
in a hot climate, I have directed that they shall
be conveyed to your Highness by the Indus,
and such river of the Punjab as may be most
easy of navigation.</p>

<p>The King has given me his most special commands
to intimate to your Highness the sincere
satisfaction with which his Majesty has witnessed
the good understanding which has for so
many years subsisted, and which may God ever
preserve, between the British Government and
your Highness.</p>

<p>His Majesty relies with confidence on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
continuance of a state of peace, so beneficial to
the subjects of both powers; and his Majesty
earnestly desires that your Highness may live
long in health and honour, extending the blessings
of beneficent government to the nations
under your Highness’s rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Runjeet
Sing’s stud.</div>

<p>As the contents of the document were unfolded,
the Maharaja gave evident symptoms of
his satisfaction; and when the letter was half
read, he said that he would greet its arrival by a
salute; and a peal of artillery from sixty guns,
each firing twenty-one times, announced to the
citizens of Lahore the joy of their King. His
Highness then expressed his intention of viewing
the presents; and we accompanied him.
The sight of the horses excited his utmost surprise
and wonder, their size and colour pleased
him: he said they were little elephants; and,
as they passed singly before him, he called out
to his different Sirdars and officers, who joined
in his admiration. Nothing could exceed the
affability of the Maharaja: he kept up an uninterrupted
conversation for the hour and a half
which the interview lasted: he enquired particularly
about the depth of water in the Indus,
and the possibility of navigating it; and put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
various questions regarding the people who occupy
its banks, and their political and military
importance. I alluded to the riches of Sinde,
which seemed to excite his utmost cupidity.
He introduced us to all the representatives of
the neighbouring states, and concluded by asking
if we should like to see his own stud. About
thirty horses were immediately brought, and
passed in review order before us. They were
caparisoned in the richest and most superb manner;
and some of them were adorned with very
valuable jewels: he named each horse, and
described his pedigree and points, as he was
brought up. They were of all countries; and
from their necks being tightly reined up, certainly
looked well; but they were not the stud
which one would have expected at Lahore&mdash;all
the horses appeared to be under-limbed. The
exertion which his Highness underwent seemed
to exhaust him, and we withdrew. Nature
has, indeed, been sparing in her gifts to this
personage; and there must be a mighty contrast
between his mind and body. He has
lost an eye, is pitted by the small pox, and his
stature does not certainly exceed five feet three
inches. He is entirely free from pomp and
show, yet the studied respect of his Court is
remarkable; not an individual spoke without a
sign, though the throng was more like a bazar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
than the Court of the first native Prince in these
times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hall of
audience.</div>

<p>The hall of audience, in which the interview
took place, was built entirely of marble, and is
the work of the Moghul Emperors; part of the
roof was gorgeously decorated by a pavilion of
silken cloth studded with jewels. The Maharaja
himself wore a necklace, armlets, and bracelets
of emeralds, some of which were very large.
His sword was mounted with the most precious
stones. The nobles were likewise dressed for
the occasion with jewels; and all the Court
appeared in yellow, the favourite colour of the
nation, which has a gaudy but striking effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military
spectacle.</div>

<p>On the following morning, the Maharaja intimated
his wish for our presence at a military
review in honour of passing events. We found
his Highness on the parade ground, seated on a
terrace, a short distance from the walls of Lahore.
Five regiments of regular infantry were
drawn up in line, three deep. Runjeet requested
we would pass down the line and inspect them.
They were dressed in white, with black cross
belts, and bore muskets, the manufacture of
Cashmere or Lahore: there was a mixture of
Hindoostanees and Seiks in every corps. After
the inspection, the brigade manœuvred under
a native general officer, and went through its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
evolutions with an exactness and precision fully
equal to our Indian troops: the words of command
were given in French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conversations.</div>

<p>During the spectacle, his Highness conversed
with great fluency, and asked our opinions on
his army and their equipments. His muskets,
he said, cost him seventeen rupees each. He
was particularly desirous to know if a column of
British troops could advance against artillery.
From these subjects he passed to that of the
revenue of Cashmere; he had just got thirty-six
lacs of rupees, he said, from it this year,
which was an increase of six lacs. “All the
people I send to Cashmere,” continued he,
“turn out rascals (haramzada); there is too
much pleasure and enjoyment in that country;”
and when he considered the importance
of the place, he believed he must send
one of his sons, or go himself. This is the
style of Runjeet Sing’s conversation; but his
inquisitive disposition, and pertinent questions,
mark the strength of his character. He found
out, among our establishment, a native of India,
who had been in England, whom he first interrogated
in our presence, and afterwards sent
for privately, to know if the wealth and power
of the British nation were as great as had been
represented. We left his Highness, on observing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
preparations for breakfast,&mdash;a meal which he
usually takes in the open air, and in presence of
his troops, and even sometimes on horseback.
His passion for riding and performing distant
journeys is great; and, on such occasions, he
will take his meal on the saddle rather than
dismount.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
officers.</div>

<p>We took up our abode in the garden-house of
M. Chevalier Ventura, another French General,
who was absent on the Indus with his legion.
The building had been constructed in the European
style; but the Chevalier has added a
terrace, with ninety fountains, to cool the surrounding
atmosphere. Our intercourse with the
French officers was on the most friendly footing;
and it continued so during our residence
at Lahore. Among these gentlemen, M. Court
struck me as an acute and well informed person;
he is both a geographer and an antiquarian.
M. Court, as well as his brother officers,
was formerly in the service of one of the
Persian Princes, and travelled to India as a
native, which gave him an opportunity of acquiring
the best information regarding the intervening
countries. He showed me the route
from Kermenshah, by Herat, Candahar, Ghuzni,
and Cabool, to Attok, constructed topographically
with great care; and he informed me, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the same time, that he had been less anxious to
obtain a complete map of that part of Asia, than
to ascertain one good route, with its détours,
and the military and statistical resources of the
country. The French have much better information
of these countries than ourselves; and
M. Court, in explaining his map to me, pointed
out the best routes for infantry and cavalry.
This gentleman has likewise employed a residence
of four years in the Punjab to illustrate
its geography; he has encountered jealousy
from Runjeet Sing, but still managed to complete
a broad belt of survey from Attok to the
neighbourhood of our own frontier. I doubt
not but the antiquities as well as the geography
of the Punjab will be illustrated by this intelligent
gentleman; who, to his honour be it said,
adds to a zeal in the pursuit, the strongest desire
to disseminate his own knowledge and stimulate
others. The fruit of M. Court’s labours, I believe,
will, ere long, be given to the public by the
Geographical Society of Paris, or some other of
the learned bodies in that capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">City of
Lahore.</div>

<p>In our evening rambles at Lahore, we had
many opportunities of viewing this city. The
ancient capital extended from east to west for a
distance of five miles; and had an average
breadth of three, as may be yet traced by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
ruins. The mosques and tombs, which have
been more stably built than the houses, remain
in the midst of fields and cultivation as caravansaries
for the traveller. The modern city
occupies the western angle of the ancient capital,
and is encircled by a strong wall. The
houses are very lofty; and the streets, which
are narrow, offensively filthy, from a gutter
that passes through the centre. The bazars of
Lahore do not exhibit much appearance of
wealth; but the commercial influence of the
Punjab is to be found at Umritsir, the modern
capital. There are some public buildings within
the city that deserve mention. The King’s
mosque is a capacious building of red sandstone,
which had been brought by Aurungzebe
from near Delhi. Its four lofty minarets still
stand, but the temple itself has been converted
into a powder magazine. There are two other
mosques, with minarets, to proclaim the falling
greatness of the Mahommedan empire; where
the “faithful,” as every where else in the Punjab,
must offer up their prayers in silence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tomb of
Juhangeer.</div>

<p>But the stranger must cross the Ravee to
behold the finest ornament of Lahore&mdash;the
“Shah Dura,” or tomb of the Emperor Juhangeer,
which is a monument of great beauty. It
is a quadrangular building, with a minaret at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
each corner, rising to the height of seventy feet.
It is built chiefly of marble and red stone, which
are alternately interlaid in all parts of the building.
The sepulchre is of most chaste workmanship,
with its inscriptions and ornaments
arranged in beautiful mosaic; the shading of
some roses and other flowers is even preserved
by the different colours of the stone. Two lines
of black letters, on a ground of white marble,
announce the name and title of the “Conqueror
of the World,” Juhangeer; and about a hundred
different words in Arabic and Persian, with the
single signification of God, are distributed on
different parts of the sepulchre. The floor of
the building is also mosaic. The tomb was formerly
covered by a dome; but Bahadoor Shah
threw it down, that the dew and rain of heaven
might fall on the tomb of his grandfather Juhangeer.
It is probable that this beautiful monument
will soon be washed into the river Ravee,
which is capricious in its course near Lahore,
and has lately overwhelmed a portion of the
garden wall that environs the tomb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shalimar.</div>

<p>The next, though by no means the least, object
of interest at Lahore is the garden of Shah
Jehan; the Shalimar or “house of joy.” It is
a magnificent remnant of Moghul grandeur,
about half a mile in length, with three successive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
terraces, each above the level of the other. A
canal, which is brought from a great distance,
intersects this beautiful garden, and throws up
its water in 450 fountains to cool the atmosphere.
The marble couch of the Emperor yet remains;
but the garden suffered much injury before
Runjeet Sing obtained his present ascendancy.
The Maharaja himself has removed some of the
marble houses; but he has had the good taste
to replace them, though it be by more ignoble
stone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conversations
of
Runjeet
Sing.</div>

<p>As we were proceeding one morning to examine
the tomb of Juhangeer, we found Runjeet
Sing seated on the plain, and surrounded by
his troops. He sent one of his officers to call
us; and we passed about half an hour with him.
He gave us an account of the inroads of the
Afghans into the Punjab, and told us that we
now sat on their ground of encampment. Zuman
Shah, the blind king at Lodiana, he said, had
thrice sacked the city of Lahore; he also talked
of his designs on India, and the vicissitudes to
which kings are subject. The Maharaja was
the plainest dressed man at his Durbar; his
clothes were shabby and worn. On the evening
of the 25th, his Highness gave us a private
audience, in which we saw him to great advantage;
for he directed his Court to withdraw.
On our arrival, we found him seated on a chair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
with a party of thirty or forty dancing girls,
dressed uniformly in boys’ clothes.


<span class="sidenote">Dancing
girls.</span>
They were
mostly natives of Cashmere or the adjacent
mountains, on whom grace and beauty had
not been sparingly bestowed. Their figures
and features were small; and their Don Giovanni
costume of flowing silk most becoming,
improved as it was by a small bow and quiver
in the hand of each. The “eyes of Cashmere”
are celebrated in the poetry of the
East, of which these Dianas now furnished
brilliant specimens, in gems black and bright;
disfigured, however, by a kind of sparkling gold
dust glued round each organ. “This,” said Runjeet
Sing, “is one of my regiments (pultuns), but
they tell me it is one I cannot discipline;” a
remark which amused us, and mightily pleased
the fair. He pointed out two of the ladies,
whom he called the “Commandants” of this
arm of his service, to whom he had given villages,
and an allowance of five and ten rupees a day.
He shortly afterwards called for four or five
elephants to take these, his <i>undisciplined</i> troops,
home. Runjeet then commenced on more important
subjects; and ran over, among other
things, the whole history of his connexion with
the British Government. It had at first, he
said, excited great suspicion and discontent
among the Seik Sirdars; but he himself was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
satisfied of its advantage from the outset. Sir
John Malcolm, he continued, had first stood his
friend in 1805; and Sir Charles Metcalfe had
completed his happiness. Sir David Ochterlony
had further cemented the bonds of friendship;
and the letter which I had now delivered to him
from the minister of the King of England
partook more of the nature of a treaty than a
common epistle, and had gratified him beyond
his powers of expression. He here recurred to
the riches of Sinde, expressing an earnest desire
to appropriate them to his own use; and put
the most pointed questions to me regarding the
feelings of Government on such a subject. Runjeet
is very fond of comparing the relative
strength of the European nations; and, on this
occasion, he asked whether France or England
were the greater power. I assured him they
were both great; but he had only to remember
our power in India to be satisfied of the military
character of Britain. “Well, then,” added
he, “what do you think of my French officers?”
After this, he wished to know if I had
heard of his campaigns across the Indus against
the “Ghazees,” or fanatics of the Mahommedan
religion; and said that he owed all his successes
to the bravery of his nation, who were very free
from prejudice, would carry eight days’ provision
on their backs, dig a well if water were scarce,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
and build a fort if circumstances required it; a
kind of service which he could not prevail on
the natives of Hindostan to perform. “The
bravery of my troops, as you are aware, conquered
Cashmere for me; and how do you
think,” said he, “I dispose of the shawls and
productions of that country in the present glut
of trade? I pay my officers and troops with
them; and as I give a Chief, who may be entitled
to a balance of 300 rupees, shawls to the
value of 500, he is well pleased, and the state
is benefited.” From the shawls of Cashmere,
Runjeet passed to the praises of wine and strong
drinks, of which he is immoderately fond: he begged
to know if I had drank the supply which he
had sent me, which, as a recommendation, he assured
us was mixed with pearls and precious gems.
This, I should mention, is a common beverage
in the East; a fashion which probably had its
origin in the giver desiring to make the grounds
as well as the contents of the bottle acceptable:
pearls would form a good glass for the butler.
We continued, till it was late, conversing with
Runjeet in this desultory manner; when he produced
a splendid bow and quiver, as also a horse
richly caparisoned, with a shawl cloth thrown
over his body, a necklace of agate, and a heron’s
plume stuck on his head, saying, “This is one of
my riding horses, which I beg you will accept.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
He also gave a similar present to Mr. Leckie;
and while we were looking at the animals, one
of the dray horses was brought forward, dressed
out in cloth of gold, and bearing an elephant’s
saddle on his back! I could not suppress a
smile at the exhibition. Runjeet then sprinkled
sandal oil and rose water over us with his own
hands, which completed the ceremony. As we
were moving, he called us back to beg that we
would attend him early next morning, and he
would order a review of his horse artillery for
our amusement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Horse artillery.</div>

<p>We met his Highness at an appointed hour on
the parade ground, with a train of fifty-one
pieces of artillery which he had assembled on
the occasion. They were brass 6-pounders,
each drawn by six horses. The command was
taken by a native officer, who put them through
the movements of horse artillery, and formed
line and column in every direction. The evolutions
were not rapidly performed; but the
celerity was considerable; and no accident in
overturning or firing occurred throughout the
morning. There were no waggons in the field,
and the horses and equipments were inferior.
The guns, however, were well cast, and the
carriages in good repair: they had been made
at Lahore, and had cost him 1000 rupees each.
As the troops were passing in review order,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
he asked for our candid opinion regarding the
display. “Every gun which you now see costs
me 5000 rupees annually, in the pay of the
officers and men, and in keeping up the horses.
I have 100 pieces of field artillery, exclusive
of battering guns and mortars, and my French
officers tell me I have too many. I can reduce
their number,” added he, “but it is a
difficult matter to increase it.” We had not
sat much longer with him, when he said, “You
must breakfast with me;” an honour with which
we would have rather dispensed, but there was
no retreating. The chairs were removed, and a
velvet cushion was placed for each of us in front
of the Maharaja, and the simple fare of this potentate
produced. It consisted of various kinds
of rice, with milk, sugar, and some preserved
mangoes; all of which were served up in leaves
sewed together. Runjeet selected the choicest
parts, and handed them to us himself; politeness
compelled us to keep him company. The
thumb and fingers are certainly a poor substitute
for the knife and fork. When breakfast was
finished, Runjeet asked if we would accept a
dinner from him; and immediately gave instructions
for its preparation, and we had it sent
to us in the evening. It was much the same
as the breakfast, and served up in a similar
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>

<p>Runjeet Sing is, in every respect, an extraordinary
character. I have heard his French
officers observe that he has no equal from Constantinople
to India; and all of them have seen
the intermediate powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character
of Runjeet
Sing.</div>

<p>We continued at Lahore as the guests of the
Maharaja till the 16th of August, and had many
opportunities of meeting him; but I do not
think I can add any thing to the history of his
rise, drawn up by the late Captain William
Murray, Political agent at Ambala. The most
creditable trait in Runjeet’s character is his humanity;
he has never been known to punish a
criminal with death since his accession to power;
he does not hesitate to mutilate a malefactor,
but usually banishes him to the hills. Cunning
and conciliation have been the two great weapons
of his diplomacy. It is too probable, that the
career of this chief is nearly at an end; his
chest is contracted, his back is bent, his limbs
withered, and it is not likely that he can long
bear up against a nightly dose of spirits more
ardent than the strongest brandy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Audience
of leave.
Precious
stones.</div>

<p>On the 16th of August we had our audience
of leave with Runjeet Sing, but my fellow traveller
was unable to attend from indisposition. Captain
Wade accompanied me. He received us in
an eccentric manner, under an open gateway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
leading to the palace. A piece of white cloth
was spread under our chairs instead of a carpet,
and there were but few of his Court in attendance.
In compliance with a wish that I had
expressed, he produced the “Koh-i-noor” or
mountain of light, one of the largest diamonds
in the world, which he had extorted from Shah
Shooja, the ex-King of Cabool. Nothing can be
imagined more superb than this stone; it is of
the finest water, and about half the size of an
egg. Its weight amounts to 3&frac12; rupees, and if
such a jewel is to be valued, I am informed it is
worth 3&frac12; millions of money, but this is a gross
exaggeration. The “Koh-i-noor” is set as an
armlet, with a diamond on each side about the
size of a sparrow’s egg.</p>

<p>Runjeet seemed anxious to display his jewels
before we left him; and with the diamond was
brought a large ruby, weighing 14 rupees. It
had the names of several kings engraven on it,
among which were those of Aurungzebe and
Ahmed Shah. There was also a topaz of great
size, weighing 11 rupees, and as large as half
a billiard ball: Runjeet had purchased it for
20,000 rupees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Presents.</div>

<p>His Highness, after assuring us of his satisfaction
at a communication having been opened
with so remote a quarter of India as Bombay, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
cemented his friendship with the British Government,
then invested me with a string of pearls:
he placed a diamond ring on one hand, and an
emerald one on the other, and handed me four
other jewels of emeralds and pearls. He then
girt round my waist a superb sword, adorned
with a knot of pearls. A horse was next brought,
richly dressed out with cloth of gold, and golden
ornaments on the bridle and saddle. A “khilut,”
or robe of honour, composed of a shawl
dress, and many other manufactures of Cashmere
were then delivered to me, as well as
presents of a similar nature for Mr. Leckie.
Three of our attendants were likewise favoured
by his Highness; and in his munificence, he sent
a sum of 2000 rupees for distribution among the
remainder of the suite. Maharaja Runjeet then
produced a letter in reply to the one which I
had brought from his Majesty’s minister, which
he requested I would deliver. It was put up in
a silken bag, and two small pearls were suspended
from the strings that fastened it. It
occupied a roll from four to five feet long. The
following is a verbal translation of the letter;
nor will it escape observation, that, with much
which is flowery and in bad taste to a European,
there is some display of sterling sense and judgment.
The titles which I had the honour to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
receive from his Highness will not pass without
a smile.</p>

Affairs of India. Delivered on the audience
of Leave.</i></h3>


<div class="blockquot">


<div class="sidenote">Runjeet
Sing’s
reply.</div>

<p>“At a happy moment, when the balmy zephyrs
of spring were blowing from the garden of
friendship, and wafting to my senses the grateful
perfume of its flowers, your Excellency’s
epistle, every letter of which is a new-blown
rose on the branch of regard, and every word
a blooming fruit on the tree of esteem, was
delivered to me by Mr. Burnes and Mr.
John Leckie, who were appointed to convey
to me some horses of superior quality, of
singular beauty, of alpine form, and elephantine
stature, admirable even in their own
country, which had been sent as a present to
me by his Majesty the King of Great Britain,
together with a large and elegant carriage.
These presents, owing to the care of the above
gentlemen, have arrived by way of the river
Sinde in perfect safety, and have been delivered
to me, together with your Excellency’s
letter, which breathes the spirit of friendship,
by that <i>nightingale of the garden of eloquence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
that bird of the winged words of sweet discourse,
Mr. Burnes</i>; and the receipt of them
has caused a thousand emotions of pleasure and
delight to arise in my breast.</p>

<p>“The information communicated in your Excellency’s
letter, that his gracious Majesty
the King of England had been much pleased
with the shawl tent of Cashmere manufacture,
which I had the honour to forward as a
present, has given me the highest satisfaction;
but my heart is so overflowing with feelings
of pleasure and gratitude for all these marks
of kindness and attention on the part of his
Majesty, that I find it impossible to give them
vent in adequate expressions.</p>

<p>“By the favour of Sri Akal Poorukh Jee<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>,
there are in my stables valuable and high-bred
horses from the different districts of Hindoostan,
from Turkistan, and Persia; but none of
them will bear comparison with those presented
to me by the King through your Excellency;
for these animals, in beauty, stature, and disposition,
surpass the horses of every city and
every country in the world. On beholding
their shoes, <i>the new moon turned pale
with envy, and nearly disappeared from the
sky</i>. Such horses, the eye of the sun has
never before beheld in his course through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
universe. Unable to bestow upon them in
writing the praises that they merit, I am compelled
to throw the reins on the neck of
the steed of description, and relinquish the
pursuit.</p>

<p>“Your Excellency has stated, that you were
directed by his Majesty to communicate to me
his earnest desire for the permanence of the
friendship which has so long existed between
the two states, and which has been so conducive
to the comfort and happiness of the
subjects of both. Your Excellency has further
observed, that his Majesty hopes that I may
live long in health and honour to rule and protect
the people of this country. I beg that
you will assure his Majesty, that such sentiments
correspond entirely with those which I
entertain, both with respect to our existing
relations, and to the happiness and prosperity
of his Majesty and his subjects.</p>

<p>“The foundations of friendship were first
established between the two states through
the instrumentality of Sir C. T. Metcalfe, a
gentleman endowed with every excellence of
character; and after that period, in consequence
of the long residence of Sir C. T. Metcalfe
in Hindostan, the edifice of mutual amity
and good understanding was strengthened and
completed by his attention and exertions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>

<p>“When the Right Honourable the Earl of
Amherst came on a visit to Hindoostan and
the Simla Hills, the ceremonials and practices
of reciprocal friendship were so well observed,
that the fame of it was diffused throughout the
whole country.</p>

<p>“Captain Wade, since his appointment at
Lodiana, has ever been solicitous to omit
nothing which was calculated to augment and
strengthen the feeling of unanimity between
the two powers.</p>

<p>“The Right Honourable Lord William Bentinck,
the present Governor-general, having
arrived some time since at Simla, I took the
opportunity of deputing respectable and confidential
officers, in company with Captain
Wade, on a complimentary mission to his
Lordship, with a letter enquiring after his
health. These officers, after having had the
honour of an interview, were dismissed by his
Lordship with marks of great distinction and
honour. On their return, they related to me
the particulars of the gracious reception they
had met with, the excellent qualities of his
Lordship, and also the sentiments of friendship
and regard which he had expressed towards
this state. These circumstances were very
gratifying to my feelings. Through the favour
of the Almighty, the present Governor-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>general
is, in every respect, disposed, like the
Earl of Amherst, to elevate and maintain the
standard of harmony and concord subsisting
between the two Governments; nay, from his
excellent qualities, I am disposed to cherish
the hope that he will be even more attentive
to this subject than his predecessor. Mr.
Burnes and Mr. John Leckie, before mentioned
as the bearers of the presents from his
Majesty, have extremely gratified me with
their friendly and agreeable conversation. The
mark of kindness and attention on the part of
the British Government, evinced by the deputation
of these officers, has increased my
friendship and regard for it a hundredfold; a
circumstance which, having become known
throughout the country, has occasioned great
satisfaction and pleasure to the friends and
wellwishers of both states, and a proportionate
regret in the hearts of their enemies. All
these particulars I hope you will bring to the
notice of his gracious Majesty.</p>

<p>“I am confident, that, through the favour of
God, our friendship and attachment, which
are evident as the noonday sun, will always
continue firm, and be daily increased under
the auspices of his Majesty.</p>

<p>“I have dismissed Mr. Burnes and Mr.
John Leckie with this friendly letter in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
reply to your Excellency’s, and hope that
these officers will, after their safe arrival at
their destination, fully communicate to you
the sentiments of regard and esteem which I
entertain for your Excellency. In conclusion,
I trust that, knowing me always to be anxious
to receive the happy intelligence of the health
and prosperity of his Majesty, and also of your
own, your Excellency will continue to gratify
me by the transmission of letters, both from
the King and from yourself.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departure
from Lahore.</div>

<p>On presenting this letter his Highness embraced
me; and begged I would convey his high
sentiments of regard to the Governor-general
of India, I then took leave of Maharaja Runjeet
Sing, and quitted his capital of Lahore the same
evening in prosecution of my journey to Simla,
on the Himalaya Mountains, where I had been
summoned to give an account of my mission to
Lord William Bentinck, then residing in that
part of India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Umritsir;
its temple.</div>

<p>We reached Umritsir, the holy city of the
Seiks, on the following morning,&mdash;a distance of
thirty miles. The intervening country, called
Manja, is richly cultivated. The great canal, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
“nuhr,” which was cut from the Ravee by
one of the Emperors of Hindostan, and brings
the water for a distance of eighty miles, passes
by Umritsir, and runs parallel with the Lahore
road. It is very shallow, and sometimes does
not exceed a width of eight feet: small boats
still navigate it. We halted a day at Umritsir,
to view the rites of Seik holiness; and our
curiosity was amply gratified. In the evening
we were conducted by the chief men of the
city to the national temple. It stands in the
centre of a lake, and is a handsome building
covered with burnished gold. After making the
circuit of it, we entered, and made an offering
to the “Grinth Sahib,” or holy book, which
lay open before a priest, who fanned it with the
tail of a Tibet cow, to keep away impurity, and
to add to its consequence. When we were
seated, a Seik arose and addressed the assembled
multitude; he invoked Gooroo Govind Sing, and
every one joined hands;&mdash;he went on to say,
that all which the Seiks enjoyed on earth was
from the Gooroo’s bounty; and that the strangers
now present had come from a great distance,
and brought presents from the King of England,
to cement friendship, and now appeared in this
temple with an offering of 250 rupees. The
money was then placed on the Grinth, and a
universal shout of “Wagroojee ka futtih!” closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
the oration. We were then clad in Cashmere
shawls; and, before departing, I begged the
orator to declare our desire for a continuance of
friendship with the Seik nation, which brought a
second shout of “Wagroojee ka futtih!” “Khalsajee
ka futtih!” May the Seik religion
prosper! From the great temple, we were taken
to the Acali boonga, or house of the Immortals,
and made a similar offering. We were not
allowed to enter this spot, for the Acalis or
Nihungs are a wrong-headed set of fanatics, not
to be trusted. In reply to the offering, the priest
sent us some sugar. The Acalis are clothed in
turbans of blue cloth, which run into a peak: on
this they carry several round pieces of iron,
weapons of defence, which are used like the
quoit. These bigots are constantly molesting
the community by abuse and insult, or even violence;
a week does not pass in the Punjab without
a life being lost: but Runjeet suppresses
their excesses with a firm and determined hand,
though they form a portion of the establishment
in a religion of which he himself is a strict
observer. He has attached some of the greatest
offenders to his battalions, and banished others.
Our conductor, Desa Sing Majeetia, father of
our Mihmandar, a Seik of the confederacy,
and a kind old man, was very solicitous about
our safety, and led us by the hand, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
grasped firmly, through the assembled crowd.
From the temple we made the tour of Umritsir,
which is a larger city than Lahore. This place
is the great emporium of commerce between
India and Cabool. The traders are chiefly
Hindoos, before whose door one wonders at
the utility of large blocks of red rock salt being
placed, till informed that they are for the use
of the sacred city cows, who lick and relish
them. In our way home we visited the Rambagh,
the favourite residence of the Maharaja
when at Umritsir. His passion for military works
also shows itself here, and he has surrounded a
pleasure garden by a massy mound of mud, which
he is now strengthening by a ditch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beas or
Hyphasis.</div>

<p>At a distance of twenty-three miles from Umritsir,
we came on the Beas or Hyphasis of
Alexander. The country is varied by trees, but
not rich, and the soil is gravelly. On the 21st
we crossed the Beas, at Julalabad, where it was
swollen to a mile in width from rain. Its current
exceeded in rapidity five miles an hour; we
were nearly two hours in crossing, and landed
about two miles below the point from which we
started. The greatest depth was eighteen feet.
The boats used in this river are mere rafts with a
prow; they bend frightfully, and are very unsafe;
yet elephants, horses, cattle, and guns are conveyed
across on them. We passed in safety, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
an accident, which might have proved serious,
befel us in one of the small channels of this
river. It was about thirty yards wide, and
eighteen feet deep, and we attempted the passage
on an elephant. No sooner had the animal got
out of his depth, than he rolled over, and precipitated
Mr. Leckie and myself head-foremost
into the water, wheeling round at the same time
to gain the bank he had quitted; Dr. Murray
alone retained his seat: but we were not long in
regaining terra firma, without any other inconvenience
than a ducking. We did not again
attempt the passage on an elephant, but crossed
on inflated buffalo skins supporting a framework.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kuppertulla.
Seik Chief.</div>

<p>Our halting place was at Kuppertulla, ten
miles from the Beas, the estate of Futtih Sing
Aloowala, one of the Seik chiefs, who was present
with Lord Lake’s army in 1805, when encamped
in this vicinity. He is yet a young man. He
received us with great respect and kindness, and
sent his two sons to meet us as we approached.


<span class="sidenote">Fête.</span>

He came himself in the evening on a visit, and
on the following day, when we returned it, he
gave us a grand fête in his garden house, which
was illuminated. The display of fireworks was
varied, and we viewed it with advantage from a
terrace. Futtih Sing is the person whom Sir
John Malcolm describes in his “Sketch of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Seiks” as requiring his dram, and years have
not diminished his taste for liquor. Immediately
we were seated he produced his bottle, drank
freely himself, and pressed it much upon us;
it was too potent for an Englishman, but he
assured us, that whatever quantity we drank,
it would never occasion thirst. We filled a
bumper to the health of the Sirdar and his
family, and were about to withdraw, when he
produced most expensive presents, which could
not in any way be refused; he gave me a string
of pearls, and some other jewels, with a sword,
a horse, and several shawls. Futtih Sing is an
uncouth looking person, but he has the manners
of a soldier. His income amounts to about four
lacs of rupees annually, and he lives up to it,
having a strong passion for house building. Besides
a board of works in two of his gardens, he
was now constructing a house in the English
style, but has sensibly added a suite of rooms
under ground for the hot season. When we left
Futtih Sing, he urgently requested that we would
deliver his sincere sentiments of regard to his old
friend Sir John Malcolm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doab of
the Sutlege.</div>

<p>We made three marches from Kuppertulla to
Fulour, on the banks of the Sutlege, a distance of
thirty-six miles, passing the towns of Jullinder
and Jumsheer. The former place is large, and
was at one time inhabited by Afghans. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
surrounded by a brick wall, and the streets are
paved with the same material. Jullinder gives
its name to the “Doab,” or country between
the Beas and Sutlege, while the other Doabs
are named by compound words, formed by contracting
the names of the rivers. Between the
Chenab and Behut, we have the Chenut; between
the Ravee and Chenab, the Reechna; and
between the Beas and Ravee, the Barree. From
Jullinder to the banks of the Sutlege, the country
is highly cultivated and well peopled. All the
villages are surrounded by mud walls, and many
of them have ditches to bespeak the once unsettled
state of this land. The houses are constructed
of wood, with flat roofs covered over by
mud, and have a hovel-like appearance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fulour.</div>

<p>The town of Fulour, on the banks of the Sutlege,
is the frontier post of the Lahore Chief,
and here we left our escort and Seik friends, who
had accompanied us from Mooltan. We distributed
cloths to the commissioned and non-commissioned
officers, and a sum of 1000 rupees
among the men, which gratified all parties.
The Maharaja continued his munificence to the
last, and, before crossing the Sutlege, he had
sent us no less than 24,000 rupees in cash,
though we had declined to receive the sum of
700 rupees, which had been fixed for our daily
allowance after reaching Lahore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Antiquities.</div>

<p>Before I finally quit the Punjab, I must
not omit a few particulars regarding its antiquities,
which must ever attract attention. It
seems certain, that Alexander the Great visited
Lahore, and to this day the remains of a city
answering to Singala, with a lake in the vicinity,
are to be seen S.E. of the capital. The tope
of Manikyala, first described by Mr. Elphinstone,
and lately examined by M. Ventura, has
excited considerable interest in the East. The
French gentlemen were of opinion, that these remains
are of an older date than the expedition
of Alexander, for the coins have a figure not
unlike Neptune’s trident, which is to be seen on
the stones at Persepolis. In my progress through
the Punjab, I was not successful in procuring
a coin of Alexander, nor any other than the
Bactrian one which I have described; nor have
any of the French gentlemen, with all their opportunities,
been so fortunate. I am happy, however,
in being able to state the existence of two
other buildings like the “Tope” of Manikyala,
which have been lately discovered among the
mountains, westward of the Indus, in the country
of the Eusoofzyes. The opening of these may
throw light on the interesting subject of Punjab
antiquities.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> By the natives of this country,
the most ancient place is considered to be Seeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>cote,
which lies upwards of forty miles north of
Lahore. It is said to be mentioned in the Persian
Sikunder Namu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cross the
Sutlege.</div>

<p>At noon, on the 26th of August, we left
Fulour and marched to Lodiana, crossing the
river Sutlege, or Hesudrus of antiquity. It is
yet called Shittoodur or the Hundred Rivers by
the natives, from the number of channels in
which it divides itself. Where we passed, its
breadth did not exceed 700 yards, though it had
been swollen two days before our arrival. The
greatest depth of soundings was eighteen feet,
but the average was twelve. It is a less rapid
river than the Beas. The waters of the Sutlege
are colder than those of any of the Punjab
rivers, probably from its great length of course,
and running so far among snowy mountains.
This river is variable in its channel, and often
deserts one bank for the other. The country
between it and the British Cantonment of Lodiana,
is intersected by nullas, one of which,
that runs past the camp, formed the bed of the
Sutlege fifty years ago. This river is generally
fordable after November. Lord Lake’s army
crossed it in 1805, two miles above Lodiana;
but the fords vary, and the watermen look
for them annually before people attempt to
cross, as there are many quicksands. When the
Beas falls into the Sutlege, the united stream,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
called Garra, is no longer fordable. The boats
of the Sutlege are of the same description as
those on the Beas: there are seventeen of them
at the Fulour ferry. The country between the
Sutlege and Lodiana is very low, which I observed
to be a characteristic of the left bank of this
river, till it meets the mountains. One would
expect to find this depressed tract of ground
alluvial, but it is sandy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exiled
Kings of
Cabool.</div>

<p>At Lodiana, we met two individuals, who
have exercised an influence on the Eastern
world, now pensioners of the British, the ex-Kings
of Cabool, Shah Zuman, and Shah Shooja-ool-Moolk.
The ceremonial of our introduction
to Shah Shooja corresponded nearly with that
described by Mr. Elphinstone; for, in his exile,
this fallen monarch has not relinquished the
forms of royalty. The officers of his court still
appear in the same fanciful caps, and on a signal
given in Turkish, (<i>ghachan</i>, begone,) the guards
run out of the presence, making a noise with
their high-heeled boots. The person of the Shah
himself has been so correctly described, that I
have little to say on that subject. In his misfortunes,
he retains the same dignity and prepossessing
demeanour as when king. We found
him seated on a chair in a shady part of his
garden, and stood during the interview. He
has become somewhat corpulent, and his ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>pression
is melancholy; but he talked much, and
with great affability. He made many enquiries
regarding Sinde, and the countries on the Indus,
and said, that “he had rebuked the Ameers for
their suspicion and jealousy of our intentions in
coming to Lahore. Had I but my kingdom,”
continued he, “how glad should I be to see an
Englishman at Cabool, and to open the road
between Europe and India.” The Shah then
touched upon his own affairs, and spoke with
ardent expectations of being soon able to retrieve
his fortunes. In reply to one of his questions,
I informed him that he had many well-wishers in
Sinde. “Ah!” said he, “these sort of people
are as bad as enemies; they profess strong
friendship and allegiance, but they render me
no assistance. They forget that I have a
claim on them for two crores of rupees, the
arrears of tribute.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reflections.</div>

<p>Shah Shooja was plainly dressed in a tunic of
pink gauze, with a green velvet cap, something
like a coronet, from which a few emeralds were
suspended. There is much room for reflection
on the vicissitudes of human life while visiting
such a person. From what I learn, I do not
believe the Shah possesses sufficient energy to
seat himself on the throne of Cabool; and that
if he did regain it, he has not the tact to discharge
the duties of so difficult a situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shah
Zuman.</div>

<p>The brother of Shah Shooja, Shah Zuman, is
an object of great compassion, from his age, appearance,
and want of sight. We also visited
him, and found him seated in a hall with but one
attendant, who announced our being present,
when the Shah looked up and bade us “Welcome.”
He is stone blind, and cannot distinguish
day from night; he was as talkative as
his brother, and lamented that he could not pass
the remainder of his days in his native land,
where the heat was less oppressive.</p>

<p>Shah Zuman has lately sunk into a zealot: he
passes the greater part of his time in listening
to the Koran and its commentaries. Poor man,
he is fortunate in deriving consolation from
any source. When taking leave, Shah Zuman
begged I would visit him before quitting Lodiana,
as he was pleased at meeting a stranger.
I did not fail to comply with his wishes, and saw
him alone. I had thought that his age and misfortunes
made him indifferent to all objects of
political interest; but he asked me, in a most
piteous manner, if I could not intercede with
the Governor-general in behalf of his brother,
and rescue him from his present exile. I assured
him of the sympathy of our government,
and said, that his brother should look to Sinde
and the other provinces of the Dooranee empire
for support; but he shook his head, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
said the case was hopeless. After a short
silence, the Shah told me that he had inflammation
in the eyes, and begged I would look at
them. He has suffered from this ever since his
brother caused him to be blinded with a lancet.
As he has advanced in years, the organ seems to
have undergone a great change, and the black
part of the eye has almost disappeared. It is
impossible to look upon Shah Zuman without
feelings of the purest pity; and, while in his
presence, it is difficult to believe we behold that
king, whose name, in the end of last century,
shook Central Asia, and carried dread and terror
along with it throughout our Indian possessions.
Infirm, blind, and exiled, he now lives on the
bounty of the British Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journey to
the Himalaya.</div>

<p>After a ten days’ recreation at Lodiana, where
we mingled once more with our countrymen, we
prosecuted our journey to Simla, on the Himalaya
mountains, a distance of about 100 miles, which
we reached in the course of a few days. We here
beheld a scene of natural sublimity and beauty,
that far surpassed the glittering court which we
had lately left:&mdash;but my narrative must here
terminate. At Simla we had the honour of
meeting the Right Honourable Lord William
Bentinck, the Governor-general of India; and
his Lordship evinced his satisfaction at the result
of our mission, by entering at once into negoti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>ations
for laying open the navigation of the Indus
to the commerce of Britain, a measure of enlightened
policy, considered both commercially
and politically. I had the honour of receiving
the following acknowledgment of my endeavours
to elucidate the geography of that river, and the
condition of the princes and people who occupy
its banks.</p>

<p>“I am directed by the Right Honourable the
Governor-general to acknowledge the receipt
of your several letters, forwarding a memoir
on the Indus, and a narrative of your journey
to Lahore.</p>

mission to Lahore, in charge of the presents
from the late King of England to Maharaja
Runjeet Sing.</p>

and attentively considered all these documents,
desires me to convey to you his high approbation
of the manner in which you have ac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>quitted
yourself of the important duty assigned
to you, and his acknowledgments for the full
and satisfactory details furnished on all the
points in which it was the desire of government
to obtain information.</p>

<p>“4. Your intercourse with the chiefs of Sinde,
and the other Sirdars and persons with whom
you were brought into contact in the course
of the voyage up the Indus, appears to the
Governor-general to have been conducted with
extreme prudence and discretion, so as to
have left a favourable impression on all classes,
and to have advanced every possible object,
immediate, as connected with your mission,
as well as prospective; for, while your communications
with them were calculated to
elicit full information as to their hopes and
wishes, you most judiciously avoided the assumption
of any political character that might
lead to the encouragement of false and extravagant
expectations, or involve you in any
of the passing intrigues. The whole of your
conduct and correspondence with the chiefs
of the countries you passed through in your
journey, has the Governor-general’s entire
and unqualified approbation.</p>

<p>“5. In like manner, his Lordship considers
you to be entitled to commendation for the
extent of geographical and general information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
collected in the voyage, and for the caution
used in procuring it, no less than for the perspicuous
and complete form in which the results
have been submitted for record and consideration.
The map prepared by you forms
an addition to the geography of India of the
first utility and importance, and cannot fail to
procure for your labours a high place in this
department of science.</p>

<p>“6. The result of your voyage in the different
reports, memoirs, and maps above acknowledged,
will be brought without delay to
the notice of the authorities in England, under
whose orders the mission was, as you are aware,
undertaken. His Lordship doubts not that
they will unite with him in commending the
zeal, diligence, and intelligence displayed by
you in the execution of this service, and will
express their satisfaction at the manner in which
their views have been accomplished, and the
objects contemplated in the mission to Lahore
fully and completely attained.</p>

THE MAP OF THE INDUS.</h2>

</div>


<p>A new map of the Indus and Punjab Rivers from the
sea to Lahore seems to require some notice explanatory
of its construction, and I have to offer the following
observations on that <span class="lock">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The River Indus, from the southern direction in which
it flows in its progress to the ocean, presents few difficulties
to the surveyor, since an observation of latitude
serves to fix the daily progress in the voyage, and its
comparatively straight course admits of easy delineation.
The map rests on a series of observations by the stars.
I should have preferred altitudes of the sun; but, with
a people so suspicious as we encountered, it was impossible
to use an instrument in daylight, and I should
have required to halt the fleet twice to procure equal
altitudes, since the sun was south of the equator during
the voyage. Many of the large places, such as Tatta,
Sehwun, Ooch, Mooltan, &amp;c., where we necessarily
halted, have been laid down from a mean of eight or
ten stellar observations.</p>

<p>The longitude and general delineations in the curvature
of the river rest on a minute protraction of its
turnings, observed with care every half hour, and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>times
oftener, with the approved compass by Schmalcalder.
The attention given to this important portion
of the undertaking may be imagined, when I state
that my field books exhibit, on an average, twenty
bearings each day from sunrise to sunset. I was
early enabled to rate the progress of the boats through
the water, by timing them on a measured line along the
bank, and apportioned the distance to the hours and
minutes accordingly. We could advance, I found, by
tracking, or being pulled by men, at one mile and a half
an hour; by gentle and favourable breezes at two miles,
and by violent winds at three miles an hour; while any
great excess or deficiency was pointed out by the latitude
of the halting place.</p>

<p>The base on which the work rests, is the towns of
Mandivee and Curachee: the one a seaport in Cutch,
and the point from which the mission started; the other
a harbour in sight of the western mouth of the Indus,
which we saw before entering the river. Mandivee
stands in the latitude of 22° 50´, and Curachee in 24° 56´
north; while their longitudes are respectively in 69° 34´,
and 67° 19´ east, as fixed, in 1809, from the chronometers
of the Sinde mission by Captain Maxfield.</p>

<p>Assuming these points as correct, the line of coast
intermediate to them has been laid down from my own
surveys in Cutch; while that of Sinde rests on observations
of the sun’s altitude at noon and the boats’ daily
progress, determined by heaving the log hourly. We
sailed only during the day, and at all times along shore,
often in a small boat, and were attended by six or eight
pilots, who had passed their lives in the navigation of
those parts.</p>

<p>The great difference in the topography of the mouths
of the Indus, from what is shown in all other maps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
will no doubt arrest attention; but it is to be remarked,
that I call in question no former survey, since
the river has been hitherto laid down in this part of
its course from <i>native information</i>; and I can bear
testimony to the correctness of such portions of the
Indus as were actually traversed by the mission of
1809. From the jealousy of the Government of Sinde,
we had to pass up and down the coast no less than
five times, which gave ample opportunities to observe
it; and I have a strong fact to adduce in verification
of the chart as it now exists. On the third voyage
we ran down so low as the latitude of 20° 30´ N.,
and were out of sight of land for six days. At noon,
on the last day (17th of March), while standing on a
due northerly course, I found our latitude to be 23° 50´,
or a few miles below that mouth of the river which I
had resolved to enter. I immediately desired the pilots
to steer a north-easterly course for the land. We closed
with it at sunset, a couple of miles above Hujamree,
the very mouth of the Indus I wished to make. At
daylight we had had no soundings in fifty fathoms, at
seven <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we had bottom at forty-two fathoms, and at
eleven in thirty-four. By two in the afternoon we were
in twenty-one fathoms, and at dusk anchored in twelve
feet of water, off Reechel, having sighted the land at
half past four.</p>

<p>In delineating the Delta of the Indus below Tatta,
I have not only had the advantage of sailing by a branch
to that city, but approached it on land by one route,
and returned by another. I also ascended the Pittee, or
western mouth of the Indus, for thirty miles. The
opposition experienced from the Sinde Government gave
rise to these variations of route: they long tried to impede
our progress; but the result of their vacillation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
has happily added to our knowledge of their country, in
a degree which the most sanguine could not have anticipated.
In addition to my own track, I have added
that of the Sinde mission, from Curachee to Hydrabad,
and thence to Lueput in Cutch. My own surveys in
Cutch, which extend high up the Koree, or eastern
branch of the Indus, together with every information,
compel me to place the Goonee or Phurraun River
(which is the name for the Koree above Ali bunder),
in a more westerly longitude than in the maps hitherto
published. Sindree and Ali bunder lie north of Nurra
in Cutch, so that the river cannot extend so far into the
desert as has been represented.</p>

<p>From Hydrabad upwards, and, I may add, in all parts
of the map, the different towns rest on the latitudes as determined
by the sextant. Most of them are in a higher
parallel than in the maps, but it was satisfactory to find,
on reaching Ooch, that the longitude of that place, as
taken from my own protraction, coincides pretty well with
that which has been assigned to it by Mr. Elphinstone’s
surveyors, who must have fixed it from Bhawulpoor.
This was not the case with Bukkur; but, as the latitude
of that place was twenty-two minutes below the true
parallel, I have reason to be satisfied with the result
above stated. I likewise found that the Indus receives
the Punjab rivers at Mittun, in the latitude of 28° 55´,
instead of 28° 20´ north, as given in the map of the
Cabool mission: but no one can examine that document
without acknowledging the unwearied zeal of its constructor,
and wondering that he erred so little when he
visited few of the places, and had his information from
such sources.</p>

<p>The Punjab rivers have been laid down on the same
principle as the Indus. The Chenab (Acesines), which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
has been erroneously styled Punjnud, after it has
gathered the other rivers, is very direct in its course;
but the Ravee (Hydräotes), on the other hand, is most
tortuous, and appears in its present shape after incredible
labour for twenty days spent in its navigation. The
latitude of its junction with the Chenab, and that of the
city of Lahore, which stands in 31° 35´ 30´´ north, and in
70° 20´ east longitude, have materially assisted me in the
task. I have also placed the confluence of the Jelum, or
Behut (Hydaspes), with the Chenab, twelve miles above
the latitude in which it has hitherto stood. The survey
eastward terminates on the left bank of the Sutledge
(Hesudrus), with the British cantonment of Lodiana,
which I find stands in 30° 55´ 30´´ north latitude. I
have used the longitude of the latest and best map, and
placed it in 75° 54´ east.</p>

<p>With the Indus and Punjab Rivers, I have embodied
a survey of the Jaysulmeer country, which was finished
in the year 1830, when I visited Southern Rajpootana
with Lieut. James Holland. The province of Cutch,
with the configuration of the Run, rests on my own surveys
made in the years 1825, 1826, 1827, and 1828.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">A GENERAL VIEW OF THE INDUS.</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Inland
navigation
to Lahore.</div>

<p>There is an uninterrupted navigation from the
sea to Lahore. The distance, by the course of
the river, amounts to about a thousand British
miles: the following papers detail its practicability
with minuteness, but not more so, I trust,
than the great importance of the subject deserves.
They also describe the state of the countries
and people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Depth of
water.</div>

<p>The Indus, when joined by the Punjab rivers,
never shallows, in the dry season, to less than
fifteen feet, and seldom preserves so great a
breadth as half a mile. The Chenab, or Acesines,
has a medium depth of twelve feet, and the
Ravee, or Hydräotes, is about half the size of
that river. These are the minima of soundings
on the voyage; but the usual depth of the three
rivers cannot be rated at less than four, three,
and two fathoms. The soundings of each day’s
voyage are shown by the figures on the map.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Boats.</div>

<p>This extensive inland navigation, open as I
have stated it to be, can <i>only</i> be considered traversable
to the boats of the country, which are
flat bottomed, and do not draw more than four
feet of water, when heavily laden. The largest
of these carry about seventy-five tons English:
science and capital might improve the build of
these vessels; but in extending our commerce,
or in setting on foot a flotilla, the present
model would ever be found most convenient.
Vessels of a sharp build are liable to upset when
they run aground on the sand-banks. Steam-boats
could ply, if constructed after the manner
of the country, but no vessel with a keel could
be safely navigated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Period of a
voyage to
Lahore.</div>

<p>The voyage from the sea to Lahore occupied
exactly sixty days; but the season was most
favourable, as the south-westerly winds had set
in, while the stronger inundations of the periodical
swell had not commenced. We reached
Mooltan on the fortieth day, and the remaining
time was expended in navigating the Ravee,
which is a most crooked river. The boats sailed
from sunrise to sunset, and, when the wind was
unfavourable, were dragged by ropes through
the water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Steam most
available
for the
Indus.</div>

<p>There are no rocks or rapids to obstruct the
ascent, and the current does not exceed two
miles and a half an hour. Our daily progress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
sometimes averaged twenty miles, by the course
of the river; for a vessel can be haled against the
current at the rate of one mile and a half an
hour. With light breezes we advanced two
miles an hour, and in strong gales we could
stem the river at the rate of three miles. Steam
would obviate the inconveniences of this slow
and tedious navigation; and I do not doubt but
Mooltan might be reached in ten, instead of
forty days. From that city a commercial communication
could best be opened with the
neighbouring countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return
voyage.</div>

<p>A boat may drop down from Lahore to the
sea in fifteen days, as follows:&mdash;to Mooltan in
six, to Bukkur in four, to Hydrabad in three,
and to the seaports in two. This is, of course,
the very quickest period of descent; and I may
add, that it has never been of late tried, for
there is no trade between Sinde and the Punjab
by water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political
obstacles to
trading on
the Indus.</div>

<p>There are political obstacles to using the
Indus as a channel of commerce. The people
and princes are ignorant and barbarous: the
former plunder the trader, and the latter over-tax
the merchant, so that goods are sent by land,
and by circuitous routes: this absence of trade
arises from no physical obstacles, and is to be
chiefly traced to the erroneous policy of the
Sinde government. There are about 700 boats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
between the sea and Lahore; and this number
suffices for ferrying, and all other purposes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military
importance
of the
Indus.</div>

<p>The defence of the Indus, the grand boundary
of British India on the West, is nowise affected
by these trifling impediments, and we can command
its navigation without obstruction from
both Cutch and the Sutledge. The military
advantages of the Indus are great: it is navigable
for a fleet from Attok to the sea. The
insulated fortress of Bukkur is a most important
position.</p>

<span class="smaller">A COMPARISON OF THE INDUS AND GANGES.</span></h2>
</div>



<p>I have recorded with care and attention the
information which I have collected regarding
the Indus and its tributaries; yet the magnitude
of that river must be decided by a comparison
with the other great rivers of the world.
An European, in the East, may appropriately
narrow his field, and confine such a comparison
to its great twin river, the Ganges, which,
with the Indus, folds, as it were, in the embrace
our mighty empire of British India. At
this time, too, in a publication which has appeared
at Calcutta, by Mr. G. A. Prinsep, regarding
the introduction of steam navigation
into India, we have late and valuable matter,
both of an interesting and scientific nature, regarding
the peculiarities of the Ganges; which,
with the previous papers of Rennell and Colebrooke,
afford very precise information regarding
that river. I have ventured, therefore,
however incompetent, to lay down the observations
that have occurred to me regarding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
Indus, that the requisite comparison might be
instituted.</p>

<p>The Ganges and Indus, rising in the same
mountains, traverse, with an unequal length of
course, the same latitudes: both rivers, though
nearly excluded from the tropics, are yet subject
to be annually flooded at a stated and the same
period. The quantity of water, therefore, which
these rivers respectively discharge, will determine
their relative size; and we shall afterwards
consider the slope or fall by which they descend
to the ocean. Sicriguli, on the Ganges, and
Tatta, on the Indus, seem to be the preferable
sites for drawing a comparison, since both places
are situated at a point <i>before</i> the rivers have
subdivided to form a delta, and <i>after</i> they have
each received the whole of their tributary
streams. The Indus certainly throws off two
branches above Tatta, the Fulailee and Pinyaree;
but they are only considerable rivers in
the rainy season.</p>

<p>It appears, then, from Mr. G. A. Prinsep’s
essay, that in the month of April the Ganges
discharges, at Sicriguli, about 21,500 cubic feet
of water in a second. The average breadth of
the river at that place is given at 5000 feet,
which is also the velocity in a second of time;
while its average depth does not exceed three
feet. That in this result we form a pretty correct
estimate of the magnitude of the Ganges, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
further proved by the state of the river at Benares
in the same month (April), where, though
contracted to a breadth of 1400 feet, the depth
exceeds thirty-four feet, and the discharge
amounts to 20,000 cubic feet per second, which
differs in but a trifling degree from that at Sicriguli.</p>

<p>In the middle of April, I found the Indus at
Tatta to have a breadth of 670 yards, and to be
running with a velocity of two miles and a half
an hour. It happens that the banks are steep
on both sides of the river in this part of its
course; so that the soundings, which amount to
fifteen feet, are regular from shore to shore, if
we except a few yards on either side, where the
water is still. This data would give a discharge
of 110,500 cubic feet per second; but by Buat’s
equations for the diminished velocity of the
stream near the bed, compared with that of the
surface, it would be decreased to 93,465 cubic
feet. Some further deduction should be made
for the diminished depth towards the shores;
and 80,000 cubic feet per second may be taken
as a fair rate of discharge of the Indus in the
month of April.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It is a source of regret to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
that I am unable to extend my observations to
the river during the rainy season; but I had not
an opportunity of seeing it at that period, and
do not desire to place opinion in opposition to
fact. I may mention, however, that at Sehwun,
where the Indus is 500 yards wide, and thirty-six
feet deep, and sweeping with great velocity
the base of a rocky buttress that juts in upon
the stream, there is a mark on the precipice
which indicates a rise of twelve feet during the
inundation. This gives a depth of eight fathoms
to this part of the Indus in the rainy season.
If I could add the increase of width on as
sound data as I have given the perpendicular
rise or depth of water, we should be able to
determine the ratio between its discharge at the
opposite seasons; but I have only the vague
testimony of the natives to guide me, and dismiss
the subject.</p>

<p>From what has been above stated, it will be
seen that the Indus, in discharging the enormous
volume, of 80,000 cubic feet of water in a
second, exceeds by <i>four times</i> the size of the
Ganges in the dry season, and nearly equals the
great American river, the Mississippi. The
much greater length of course in the Indus and
its tributaries, among towering and snowy mountains
near its source, that must always contribute
vast quantities of water, might have prepared us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
for the result; and it is not extraordinary, when
we reflect on the wide area embraced by some
of these minor rivers, and the lofty and elevated
position from which they take their rise: the
Sutledge, in particular, flows from the sacred
Lake of Mansurour, in Tibet, 17,000 feet above
the sea. The Indus traverses, too, a comparatively
barren and deserted country, thinly
peopled and poorly cultivated; while the Ganges
expends its waters in irrigation, and blesses the
inhabitants of its banks with rich and exuberant
crops. The Indus, even in the season of inundation,
is confined to its bed by steeper and more
consistent banks than the other river; and, as I
have stated, seldom exceeds half a mile in width:
the Ganges, on the other hand, is described as an
inland sea in some parts of its course; so that,
at times, the one bank is scarcely visible from
the other,&mdash;a circumstance which must greatly
increase the evaporation. The arid and sandy
nature of the countries that border the Indus
soon swallow up the overflowing waters, and
make the river more speedily retire to its bed.
Moreover, the Ganges and its subsidiary rivers
derive their supply from the southern face of
the great Himalaya; while the Indus receives
the torrents of either side of that massy chain,
and is further swollen by the showers of Cabool
and the rains and snow of Chinese Tartary. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
waters are augmented long before the rainy season
has arrived; and, when we look at the distant
source of the river, to what cause can we
attribute this early inundation but to melting
snow and ice?</p>

<p>The slope on which the Indus descends to
the ocean would appear to be gentle, like that
of most great rivers. The average rate of its
current does not exceed two miles and a half an
hour; while the whole of the Punjab rivers,
which we navigated on the voyage at Lahore,
were found to be one full mile in excess of the
Indus. We readily account for this increased
velocity by their proximity to the mountains;
and it will serve as a guide in estimating the
fall of the river. The city of Lahore stands at
a distance of about 1000 British miles from the
sea, by the course of the river; and I am indebted
to Dr. J. G. Gerard, for a series of barometrical
observations, made some years ago
at Umritsir, a city about thirty miles eastward
of Lahore.</p>

<table class="autotable" summary="barometrical observations">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">The mean of eighteen of these observations gives us the height of the barometer at</td>
<td class="tdr">28,861·3</td>

<td class="tdr total">850·2</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span></p>

<p>I am informed that the height of the instrument
registered in Calcutta may be twenty-five
feet above the level of the sea; and as the city
of Umritsir is about the same level as Lahore
(since both stand on the plains of the Punjab),
it must have an elevation of about 900 feet from
the sea.</p>

<p>Having now stated the sum of our knowledge
regarding this subject, it remains to be considered
in what, and how great a proportion,
the slope is to be distributed among the rivers
from Lahore downwards. By a comparison with
the Ganges in Rennell’s work, and the late treatise
to which I have alluded, and assisted by
the same scientific gentleman, to whom I have
before expressed my obligations, we cannot give
a greater fall downwards from Mittun, where
the Indus receives the Punjab rivers, than six,
or perhaps five, inches per mile: nor can we
allow more than one fourth of 900 feet as the
height of that place above the level of the sea;
for the river has not increased here in velocity
of current, though we have neared the mountains.
Mittun is half way to Lahore, about 500
miles from the sea, and nearly 220 feet above it.
The remaining 680 feet we may fairly apportion
to the Punjab rivers, from their greater rapidity
of course; which would give them a fall of twelve
inches per mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>In these facts, we have additional proof of
the greater bulk of the Indus, as compared with
the Ganges; when at the lowest, it retains a
velocity of two and a half miles, with a medial
depth of fifteen feet, and though running on as
great, if not a greater slope than that river, never
empties itself in an equal degree, though much
more straight in its course. The Indus has
none of those ledges, which have been lately
discovered as a peculiarity of the Ganges, and
which are described in Mr. Prinsep’s work as
“making the bed of that river consist of a series
of pools, separated by shallows or sand-bars, at
the crossing of every reach.” Were the Indus
as scantily supplied with water as the Ganges,
we should, doubtless, find a similar state of
things; and, though the bed of the one river
would appear to far exceed in magnitude that
of the other, we find the Ganges partaking much
of the nature of a hill-torrent, overflowing at
one season, insignificant at another; while the
Indus rolls on throughout the year, in one
majestic body, to the Ocean.</p>

<p>Before bringing these remarks on the Indus
to a close, I wish to add a few words regarding
the effect of the tide on the two rivers. In the
Ganges it runs considerably above Calcutta,
while no impression of it is perceptible in the
Indus twenty-five miles below Tatta, or about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
seventy-five miles from the sea. We are either
to attribute this occurrence to the greater column
of water resisting the approach of the
sea, “whose vanquished tide, recoiling from the
shock, yields to the liquid weight;” or to the
descent of the delta of the one river being
greater than that of the other. The tide in the
Indus certainly runs off with incredible velocity,
which increases as we near the sea. It would
appear that the greatest mean rise of tide in
the Ganges is twelve feet: I found that of the
Indus to be only nine feet at full moon; but
I had, of course, no opportunity of determining
the <i>mean</i> rise of the tide as in the Ganges.
The tides of Western India are known to exceed
those in the Bay of Bengal, as the construction
of docks in Bombay testifies; and I
should be disposed to consider the rise at the
mouths of the Indus and Ganges to be much
the same. Both rivers, from the direction they
fall into the ocean, must be alike subject to an
extraordinary rise of tide from gales and winds;
and, with respect to the whole coast of Sinde,
the south-west monsoon blows so violently, even
in March, as to break the water at a depth of
three or four fathoms from the land, and long
before its depressed shore is visible to the
navigator.</p>

<span class="smaller">ON SINDE.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">Sinde; its
extent.</div>

<p>The first territory which we meet in ascending
the Indus is Sinde. The subversion of the
Cabool monarchy has greatly raised the political
importance of this country; and, while it has
freed the rulers of it from the payment of a
yearly tribute, has enabled them to extend
widely the limits of their once circumscribed
dominion. The principality is at present in the
zenith of its power, and comprises no less than
100,000 square miles, extending from the longitude
of 69° to 71° east, and from the latitude
of 23° to 29° north. The Indian Ocean washes
it on the south, and a diagonal line of 400 miles
is terminated a short distance below the junction
of the waters of the Punjab with the Indus.
The eastern portion of this fine territory is sterile
and unproductive; but the Indus fertilises its
banks by the periodical swell, and the waters
are conducted by canals far beyond the limits
of inundation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its chiefs
and revenue.</div>

<p>The territory is divided among three different
branches of the Belooche tribe of Talpoor, who
are nearly independent of one another. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
principal family resides at Hydrabad, at the head
of which is Meer Moorad Ali Khan, and, since
the death of his three elder brothers, its sole representative.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The next family of importance
consists of the descendants of Meer Sohrab
Khan of Khyrpoor, whose son, Meer Roostum
Khan, is the reigning Ameer, and holds the fortress
of Bukkur, with the northern portion of
Sinde. The third family, descended of Meer
Thara Khan, at the head of which is Ali Morad,
resides at Meerpoor, and possesses the country
south-east of the capital. These three chiefs
are, properly speaking, the “Ameers of Sinde,”
a name which has been sometimes applied to
the members of the Hydrabad family. The
relative importance of the Ameers is pointed
out in their revenues: fifteen, ten, and five lacs
of rupees are the receipts of the different chiefs;
and their aggregate amount, thirty lacs of rupees,
shows the annual revenue of Sinde. The treasure,
it is said, amounts to about twenty millions
sterling, thirteen of which are in money, and the
remainder in jewels. The greater portion of this
cash lies deposited in the fort of Hydrabad, and
is divided between Moorad Ali and the wives of
his late brother, Kurm Ali.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Its power
and conquests.</div>

<p>If we except the Seiks, the Ameers are more
powerful than any of the native princes to whose
dominions the territories of Sinde adjoin; for on
every side they have seized and maintained by
force the lands of their neighbours. To the
westward they hold Curachee as a conquest
from the chief of Lus, and are at present meditating
an extension of their boundary towards
Sonmeeanee, that they may keep the trade to
Candahar entirely within their own dominions.
To the north-west they seized the fort of Bukkur,
and the fertile territory of Shikarpoor, from the
Afghans; and, though it latterly belonged to
the powerful family of Barakzye (who now hold
Cabool, Candahar, and Peshawur), they have
hitherto engaged in annual but fruitless attempts
to retake it. A force of 6000 men were encamped
at Sewee, in the plains of Cutch Gundava,
when we passed Shikarpoor; but they were
unable to meet the Sindians in the field. On
the north-east the Ameers hold Subzulcote and
a large portion of the Daoodpootra country.
To the eastward, they captured the fortress of
Omercote, in 1813, from the Joodpoor Raja,
and have since pushed their troops far into that
Prince’s territories. If we exclude a portion of
that country which belongs to Jaysulmeer, they
now possess the whole country south of that
capital to the Runn of Cutch, Parkur included.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
On the side of Cutch alone their progress has
been arrested by the British Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its military
strength.</div>

<p>The value of these conquests is greatly enhanced
by the trifling increase of expense which
they have entailed on the government; for, except
in the forts of the Desert, neither garrisons
nor troops are kept in pay to protect them,
while every attack endangering their security
has been hitherto successfully resisted. The
conduct of the Sindian in the field is brave;
and if we are to judge by results, he is superior
to his neighbours. They parried off an inroad
of one formidable army from Cabool by a retreat
to the Desert; and they defeated a second
with great slaughter in the vicinity of Shikarpoor.
Destitute as they are of discipline, and
unable, assuredly, to cope with regular troops,
we must admit that they excel in the art of war
as practised by themselves and the adjacent
nations. The Sindians, unlike other Asiatics,
pride themselves on being foot soldiers, and
they prefer the sword to the matchlock: their
artillery, formidable in number, is contemptible
in strength; their cavalry does not deserve the
name: horses are scarce, and of a very diminutive
breed. Various surmises have been made
regarding the strength of their army, but they
seem to me vague and indefinite; for every
native who has attained the years of manhood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
the mercantile classes alone excepted, becomes
a soldier by the constitution of the government;
and he derives his food and support in time of
peace from being pledged to give his services in
war. The host to be encountered is therefore
a rabble, and, as infantry, their swords would
avail them but little in modern warfare with an
European nation. On an attack from the British
Government, it is probable that the rulers of
Sinde, after a feeble resistance, would betake
themselves, with their riches, as of yore, to the
Desert, a retreat which would cost them, in this
instance, their country. They might foment for
a while conspiracy and rebellion, but the misfortunes
of the house of Talpoor would excite
compassion nowhere; for their government is
unpopular with their subjects, and dreaded, if
not hated, by the neighbouring nations.</p>

<p>In the decline of other Mahommedan states,
the prosperity of Sinde has exalted it in the
eyes of foreigners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its external
policy.</div>

<p>Of the princes bordering on Sinde, the
Ameers have most intercourse with Mehrab
Khan, the Brahooee chief of Kelat and Gundava,
who, like themselves, was formerly a tributary
of Cabool. By this alliance they have
skilfully interposed a courageous people together,
with a strong country between their territories
and that kingdom. The Afghans have endea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>voured
by bribes and promises to bring over the
Kelat chief to their interests, but he has not
been hitherto persuaded, and professes himself,
on all occasions, ready to assist the Ameers in
the protection of that part of their frontier adjoining
his dominions. He is related by marriage
to the Hydrabad Ameer; and the Brahooees
and Beloochees, considering themselves to be
originally descended from one stock, may be
therefore supposed to have one common interest.
With the Seiks at Lahore there is no cordiality,
and but little intercourse: they dread, and with
reason, Runjeet Sing’s power, and they are likewise
anxious to avoid giving offence to any of
the Cabool family by a show of friendship.
They owe the Maharaja no allegiance, nor has he
hitherto exacted any; but it has not escaped
their observation, that, of all the countries which
adjoin the Sindian dominions, there are none
from which an invasion can be so easily made
as from the Punjab, and it is very doubtful if
they could withstand an attack conducted by
the Seiks from that quarter. With the Rajpoot
chiefs on their eastern frontier their intercourse
is confined to the exchange of presents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its internal
state.</div>

<p>The internal resources of Sinde are considerable;
nor must we look to the confined revenues
of her rulers for an index to that wealth, as in
their struggle for supremacy, the Ameers re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>ceived
many favours from their Belooch brethren,
which have been repaid by large and numerous
grants of land. By deteriorating the value of
what remained as their own share, they hope to
allay the cupidity of their neighbours. Trade and
agriculture languish in this land. The duties exacted
on goods forwarded by the Indus are so exorbitant
that there is no merchandise transported
by that river, and yet some of the manufactures
of Europe were to be purchased as cheap at
Shikarpoor as in Bombay. We are informed in
the Periplus of the Erythrean sea, that the traffic
of Sinde, when ruled by a powerful prince in the
second century of the Christian era, was most
extensive, and it is even said to have been considerable
so late as the reign of Aurungzebe.
The present rulers, possessing as they do such
unlimited authority over so wide a space, might
raise up a wealthy and commercial kingdom;
but the river Indus is badly situated for the
trader, and has no mouth like the Ganges accessible
to large ships: it is separated, too, from
India by an inhospitable tract; and a very
vigorous and energetic government could alone
protect commerce from being plundered by the
Boordees, Moozarees, and other hill tribes to
the westward. The Indus can only become a
channel for commerce when the chiefs possessing
it shall entertain more enlightened notions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
At present much of the fertile banks of this river,
so admirably adapted for agriculture, are only
used for pasture. Flocks and herds may be
driven from the invader; but the productions
of the soil can only be reaped in due season,
after care and attention. I now proceed to describe
the state of parties at present existing in
Sinde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hydrabad
family.</div>

<p>The Hydrabad family, from having been
visited by several British missions, is better
known than any of the others. It includes the
southern portion, or what is called “Lower
Sinde.” Since its first establishment, in 1786,
it has undergone great change; and the reins of
government, from being wielded by four brothers,
have been left without bloodshed in the
hands of the last survivor. But the struggle for
dominion, so long warded off, has been bequeathed
to a numerous progeny; and on the
death of Moorad Ali Khan, who has attained
his sixtieth year, the evil consequences of the
founder of the family, raising his brothers to
an equality with himself, will be felt in a disputed
succession, and perhaps in civil war.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> One
Ameer died without issue; two of them left
sons who have now attained to manhood, and
the remaining Ameer has a family of five chil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>dren,
two of whom, Noor Mahommed and Nusseer
Khan, have for years past sat in durbar on
an equality with their cousins, Sobdar and Mahommed.
The different parties of these four
young princes form so many separate factions
in the court of Sinde, and each uses that influence
and policy which seems best suited to
advance its ends. Three of them, as the eldest
descendants of Ameers, might claim a right of
sharing as their fathers; but the second son of
Moorad Ali Khan has greater weight than any
of them, and the government of the Ameers of
Sinde could never, as it first stood, be considered
an hereditary one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meer Nusseer
Khan,
and Meer
Mahommed.</div>

<p>Meer Nusseer Khan, to whose influence I have
just alluded, has been brought forward by his
father in the intercourse with the British, and
though fourth in rank below the Ameer himself:
he is the only person who, with his father,
addresses, on all occasions, and is addressed by,
the British Government. He openly professes
his attachment to the English, and informed me
by letters, and in two public durbars, that he
had been the means of procuring a passage for
the mission by the Indus to Lahore. Strange
as it may appear, it is said that his parent, otherwise
so jealous of the British, had strenuously
advised this line of procedure in his son; nor
was it disguised from me by many who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
opportunities of knowing, that the Prince acted
under the hope of assistance from our Government
when the hour of difficulty arrived. Nusseer
Khan maintains likewise a friendly intercourse
with several members of the fallen monarchy of
Cabool; and while we were at Hydrabad he
was despatching presents to Kamran at Herat.
This prince is a mild and engaging man, much
attached to the sports of the field. He has more
liberality than talent, and less prudence than
becomes one in the difficult part which he will
shortly have to perform. His success will depend
on the possession of his father’s wealth,
for money is the sinew of war; and the good
will of a venal people like the Sindians is not
to be retained by one who has spent his inheritance.
Noor Mahommed, the eldest brother of
Nusseer Khan, cultivates a closer friendship with
the Seiks than any other of the Talpoor family,
but he has neither partisans nor ability to achieve
an enterprise. He is, besides, addicted to the
grossest debauchery and the most odious vices;
but it is always to be remembered that he is the
eldest son of the reigning chief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahommed
and
Sobdar.</div>

<p>Meer Mahommed seems to hope, and not
without cause, that the services of his father,
Gholam Ali, will secure to him his rights. He
sent a messenger to me privately with an offer
to enter into a secret treaty with the British Go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>vernment,
which I declined for obvious reasons.
Sobdar is the rightful heir of Moorad Ali, being
the eldest son of the founder of the house. He
is no favourite with the Ameers; but, besides a
treasure of three millions sterling, and lands
which yield him three lacs of rupees annually, he
has many chiefs and partisans, who cling to him
from a remembrance of his father’s virtues. He
is, too, the ablest “scion of the stock,” and by
one rebellion has already asserted his rights. The
contest will probably lie between Sobdar and Nusseer
Khan; and if these two choose to govern as
those who preceded them, they may revive the
title and retain the power of the Ameers of
Sinde. At present, Meer Sobdar conceals his
plans and intentions from dread of his uncle;
and I may mention, as a specimen of Sindian
jealousy, that because I asked several times after
his health (according to the formality of this
court), seeing him seated on the right hand
of the Ameer, he was displaced at our second
interview to make room for Meer Nusseer Khan.
Should Moorad Ali attain “a good old age”
these opinions may prove fallacious, as the stage
will then be occupied by other competitors, who
are at present in their childhood, and from
among whom some one, more daring than his
relations, may meet with success and power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Khyrpoor
family.</div>

<p>The Khyrpoor chief, Meer Roostum Khan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
succeeded to his father, who was killed in 1830
by a fall from a balcony. He is about fifty
years of age, and has five sons and two brothers.
This family is so numerous that there
are at present forty male members of it alive,
descended in a right line from Meer Sohrab
Khan. The chief maintains greater state than
the Hydrabad family. The territory is extensive
and productive, extending on the east bank
from a short distance above Sehwun to the
latitude of 28° 30´ north, and on the west bank
from Shikarpoor to within fifteen miles of Mittun,
on the verge of the Punjab, skirting to the
westward the mountain of Gendaree and the
plains of Cutch Gundava. There is little cordiality
existing between the Khyrpoor and Hydrabad
Ameers; and the breach has been
lately increased by some disputes relative to the
duties on opium, of which the former have
hitherto, and in vain, claimed a share. The
whole family expressed themselves cordially attached
to the British Government; and evinced,
by a continual succession of kindness, and even
munificence towards our party, that they were
sincere in their sentiments: none of them had
ever before seen an European. The treasure,
which amounts to three millions of money, is held
by Ali Moorad, the youngest brother of Meer
Roostum Khan, who having access to it, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
favourite son, seized it on Sohrab’s death, and
still retains it. With this exception, the family
are united, and have no subject of dissension.</p>

<p>The influence of the chief of Khyrpoor in
the affairs of Sinde is considerable. No undertaking
which has reference to the well-being
of the country is planned without his being
consulted; and hitherto no operations have
been carried on without his sanction. The refusal
of Meer Sohrab to enter into a war to
protect the Daoodpootras, and prevent encroachment
by the Seiks, defeated the plans of the
Ameers; for though the families are independent
of one another, they will only act when
united. Meer Roostum Khan is on much better
terms with his neighbours than the Hydrabad
family: he has agents from the Jaysulmeer and
Beecaneer Rajas, and from the Daoodpootras,
resident at his court, and has more intercourse
with the Seiks at Lahore. Meer Roostum is
prepared, however, on all occasions with his
troops to protect from invasion the boundaries
of Sinde as they at present exist; and has
readily furnished his quota of troops when the
Afghans have endeavoured to retake Shikarpoor
from the Hydrabad chief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meerpoor
family.</div>

<p>The Meerpoor family, at the head of which is
Ali Moorad, has the least influence of the Sinde
Ameers. His immediate vicinity to Hydra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>bad,
and his less fertile and more circumscribed
boundary, have kept it more under the subjection
of the principal Ameer. The territory,
however, is exactly situated on the line of invasion
for an army from Cutch; and this Ameer
might render material service to any expedition.
The family is allied to Sobdar; and will, in all
probability, follow that prince’s fortunes on a
change of government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condition
of the
people.</div>

<p>With reference to the condition of the people
in these different chiefships, much has been said
by various writers; and I would have willingly
passed it unnoticed, did not the means of observation,
which I enjoyed for so many months,
lead me to dissent from some of their opinions.
The Sindians are passionate and proud; and all
of them would be considered deceitful, in so far
as they praise and promise without sincerity.
Their passion proceeds from their savage ignorance,
and their pride from jealousy: their
deceit does not deceive each other, and, consequently,
ought not to deceive a stranger. I
found those in my employ most honest and faithful
servants, and passed from one extremity of
Sinde to another without any other guard than
the natives of the country, and without losing a
trifle, though our boats were boarded by crowds
daily. The Sindians are governed by their
princes, after the spirit of the country; and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
they could discern how much the advantages of
civil life, and the encouragement of industry
and art, rise superior to despotic barbarism, we
might look upon Sinde and her people in a different
light: but these rulers, who seized it by
the sword, must be excused for so maintaining
it. Where the principles of honour are not understood
(as has ever been too much the case in
Asiatic governments), men must be ruled by
fear; and it is only as the subject gets liberal
and civilised, that he can appreciate the advantages
of free institutions, and deserves such or
any share in the government of his country.
The inhabitants of Sinde are miserably poor,
both in the towns and villages; for when we
except a few Belooche chiefs, and some religious
families, who are attached to the court, there is
no distributed wealth in the land but among a
few Hindoo merchants. The people of that
tribe share no greater evils than their Mahommedan
brethren, and enjoy as much toleration
and happiness as in other Moslem governments.
If they were formerly treated with rigour, the
age of fanaticism has passed; and the Hindoo Dewans
of Sinde now transact the entire pecuniary
concerns of the state, while the Shroffs and Banians,
who are also Hindoos, pursue their vocations
without interruption, marry off their
children, when they attain the prescribed age,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
to inherit, after their demise, the substance
which had been realised by commerce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its extent
of population.</div>

<p>It is difficult to fix the population of Sinde,
and I bear in mind that I have seen the fairest
portion of the country in my progress through
it by the Indus. The large towns are neither
numerous nor extensive: Hydrabad, the capital,
has about 20,000 people, but it is exceeded by
Shikarpoor: Tatta, Currachee, and Khyrpoor
have 15,000 each; Meerpoor, Hala, Sehwun,
Larkhana, and Roree (with Sukkur), have each
about 10,000; Muttaree, Ulyartando, and Subzul,
with five or six others, have 5000 each;
which gives a population of nearly 200,000
souls. The number of people in the delta
does not exceed 30,000; and the parts away
from the river, both to the east and west, are
thinly peopled, for pastoral countries are not
populous. The villages within reach of the
inundation are, however, large and numerous;
and, including the whole face of the country,
there cannot be less than a million of human
beings. One fourth of this number may be
Hindoos; and the greater portion of the Mahommedans
are descended from converts to that
religion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAP_IVa">CHAP. IV.<br />

<span class="smaller">ON THE MOUTHS OF THE INDUS.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">The Indus.</div>

<p>The Indus, like the Nile and the Ganges,
reaches the ocean by many mouths, which,
diverging from the parent stream, form a delta
of rich alluvium. At a distance of sixty miles
from the sea, and about five miles below the
city of Tatta, this river divides into two branches.
The right arm is named Buggaur, and the left
Sata. This separation is as ancient as the days
of the Greeks, and mentioned by the historians
of Alexander the Great.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two great
branches
forming its
delta.</div>

<p>Of these two branches, the left one, or Sata,
pursues nearly a southern course to the ocean,
following the direction of the great river from
which it is supplied; while the right, or Buggaur,
deviates at once from the general track of
the Indus, and reaches the sea, by a westerly
course, almost at right angles to its twin river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sata.</div>

<p>The eastern branch, or Sata, is the larger of
the two, and below the point of division is one
thousand yards wide: it now affords egress to
the principal body of the water; and though it
divides and subdivides itself into numerous channels,
and precipitates its water into the sea by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
less than seven mouths within the space of thirty-five
miles, yet such is the violence of the stream,
that it throws up sand banks or bars, and only
one of this many-mouthed arm is ever entered
by vessels of fifty tons. The water sent out to
sea from them during the swell of the river is
fresh for four miles; and the Gora, or largest
mouth, has cast up a dangerous sand bank,
which projects directly from the land for fifteen
miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Buggaur.</div>

<p>The western arm, which is called Buggaur,
on the other hand, flows into one stream past
Peer Putta, Bohaur, and Darajee, to within five
or six miles of the sea, when it divides into two
navigable branches, the Pittee and Pieteanee,
which fall into the ocean about twenty-five miles
apart from each other. These are considered the
two great mouths of the Indus, and were frequented
till lately by the largest native boats.
They are yet accessible, but for three years
past the channel of the Buggaur has been deserted
by the river; and though it contains
two fathoms of water as high as Darajee, it
shallows above that town. In the dry season
it is in some places but knee-deep, and its bed,
which continues nearly half a mile broad, has
at that time but a breadth of 100 yards. The
name of Buggaur signifies “destroy.” While<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
this alteration has diverted the trade from Darajee
to the banks of the Sata, the country near
the Buggaur is as rich as it was previously;
and though the branch itself is not navigated,
yet there are frequently two fathoms in its bed,
and every where a sufficiency of water for flat-bottomed
boats. During the swell it is a fine
river, and will in all probability shortly regain
its former pre-eminence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Delta; its
size.</div>

<p>The land embraced by both these arms of the
delta extends, at the junction of the rivers with
the sea, to about seventy British miles; and so
much, correctly speaking, is the existing delta
of this river. The direction of the sea-coast
along this line of rivers is north-north-west.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Delta may
be considered
longer.</div>

<p>But the Indus covers with its waters a wider
space than that now described, and has two
other mouths still further to the eastward than
those thrown out by the Sata, the Seer, and
Koree, the latter the boundary line which divides
Cutch from Sinde, though the rulers of that
country have diverted the waters of both these
branches by canals for irrigation, so that none
of them reach the sea. With the addition
of these forsaken branches, the Indus presents
a face of about 125 British miles to the sea,
which it may be said to enter by eleven
mouths. The latitude of the most western
embouchure is about 24° 40´ N., that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
eastern below 28° 30´, so that in actual latitude
there is an extent of about eighty statute miles.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dangers of
navigating
the delta.</div>

<p>The inconstancy of the Indus through the
delta is proverbial, and there is here both difficulty
and danger in its navigation. It has in
these days, among the people of Sinde, as bad
a character as has been left to it by the Greek
historians. The water is cast with such impetuosity
from one bank to another, that the
soil is constantly falling in upon the river;
and huge masses of clay hourly tumble into
the stream, often with a tremendous crash.
In some places the water, when resisted by a
firm bank, forms eddies and gulfs of great
depth, which contain a kind of whirlpool, in
which the vessels heel round, and require every
care to prevent accident. The current in such
places is really terrific, and in a high wind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
waves dash as in the ocean. To avoid these
eddies, and the rotten parts of the bank, seemed
the chief objects of care in the boatmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peculiarities
of
navigation.</div>

<p>It is a fact worthy of record, that those mouths
of the Indus, which are least favoured by the
fresh water, are most accessible to large vessels
from the sea; for they are more free from sand
banks, which the river water, rushing with violence,
never fails to raise. Thus the Buggaur,
which I have just represented as full of shallows,
has a deep and clear stream below Darajee to
the sea. The Hoogly branch of the Ganges is,
I believe, navigable from a similar cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Individual
mouths.</div>

<p>I shall now proceed to describe the several
mouths with their harbours, depth of water, together
with such other facts as have fallen under
notice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pittee.</div>

<p>Beginning from the westward, we have the
Pittee mouth, an embouchure of the Buggaur,
that falls into what may be called the bay of
Curachee. It has no bar; but a large sand
bank, together with an island outside, prevent
a direct passage into it from the sea, and
narrow the channel to about half a mile at its
mouth. At low water its width is even less
than 500 yards: proceeding upwards, it contracts
to 160, but the general width is 300. At
the shallowest part of the Pittee there was a
depth of nine feet at low water, and the tide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
rose nine feet more at full moon. At high
water there is every where a depth of two
fathoms to Darajee, and more frequently five
and six, sometimes seven and eight. Where
two branches meet, the water is invariably
deep. At a distance of six miles up the
Pittee there is a rock stretching across the
river: it has nine feet of water on it at low
tide. The general course of the Pittee for the
last thirty miles is W.N.W., but it enters the
sea by a channel due south. The Pittee is
exceedingly crooked, and consists of a succession
of short turnings, in the most opposite
directions; even from south to north the water
from one angle is thrust upon another, which
leaves this river alternately deep on both sides.
Where the banks are steep, there will the channel
be found; and, again, where they gradually
meet the water, shallows invariably exist. This,
however, may be remarked of all rivers which
flow over a flat country. There is no fresh
water in the Pittee nearer than thirty miles from
the sea: the brushwood on its banks is very
dense, and for fifteen miles up presses close in
upon the river. We navigated this branch to
that extent, and crossed it in two places higher
up, at Darajee and Bohaur, where it had two
fathoms’ water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pieteeanee.</div>

<p>The Pieteeanee quits the Pittee about twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
miles from the sea, which it enters below the
latitude of 24° 20´. It is narrower than the
Pittee, and in every respect an inferior branch;
for there are sand banks in its mouth, which
overlap each other, and render the navigation
intricate and dangerous. We found it to have
a depth of six feet on its bar at low tide, and
fifteen at full; but when once in its channel,
there were three fathoms’ water. At its mouth
it is but 300 yards wide, and higher up it contracts
even to fifty; but it has the same depth
of water every where till it joins the Pittee.
The Pieteeanee runs north-easterly into the
land, and from its shorter course the tide makes
sooner than in the Pittee, which presented the
singular circumstance of one branch running
up, and the other down, at the same time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inferior
creeks.</div>

<p>Connected with these two mouths of the
Indus, there are three inferior creeks, called
Koodee, Khow, and Dubboo. The two first join
the Pittee; and the Koodee was in former years
one of the great entrances to Darajee, but its
place has been usurped by the Pieteeanee, and
it is now choked. Dubboo is only another
entrance to the Pieteeanee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indus navigated
by
flat-bottomed
boats.</div>

<p>However accessible these two branches have
been found, neither of them are navigated by
any other than flat-bottomed boats, which carry
the entire cargo to and from the mouth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
river, inside which the sea vessels anchor. It
was an unheard-of occurrence for boats like the
four that conveyed us (none of them twenty-five
tons in burden) to ascend so high up the
Pittee as we did, a distance of thirty miles;
but assuredly we encountered no obstacles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jooa,
Reechel,
and Hujamree.</div>

<p>Of the seven mouths that give egress to the
waters of the Sata, or eastern branch, below
Tatta, the Jooa, Reechel, and Hujamree, lie
within ten miles of each other. One of these
mouths has been at all times more or less navigable;
and while they are the estuaries of the
waters of the Sata, still a portion of those thrown
off by the Buggaur, or other grand arm, reach
them by inferior creeks during the swell, forming
an admirable inland navigation through all parts
of the delta. The mouths of the Jooa and
Reechel are choked; but the latter was at a late
period the most frequented of all the branches of
the Indus. It was formerly marked by a minaret,
which has, I suppose, fallen down, as this
fact is particularly mentioned by our early navigators.
There is yet a village, near its mouth,
called Moonara, or minaret. The Hujamree is
now accessible to boats of fifty tons. Its port
is Vikkur, twenty-five miles from the sea, which,
with Shah-bunder (still further eastward), seems
alternately to share the trade of the delta. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
season Shah-bunder is scarcely to be approached,
and the next season Vikkur will perhaps be
deserted. We entered the Indus by the Hujamree
mouth, and disembarked at Vikkur. At
the bar we had fifteen feet of water at high tide,
and a depth of four fathoms all the way to
Vikkur, even when the tide was out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Khedywaree.</div>

<p>The Khedywaree is the next mouth eastward
of Hujamree, with which it is connected by
small creeks; it is shallow, and not much frequented
by boats but to cut firewood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gora, or
Wanyanee.</div>

<p>Of the remaining mouths of the left arm, the
next is Gora, the largest of all the mouths. It
derives its supply of water direct from the Sata,
which near the sea feeds numerous small creeks,
and is named Wanyanee. From the Hujamree
we passed by a narrow creek into this mouth of the
Indus. The Gora (or, as it is also called towards
the sea, Wanyanee,) has every where a depth of
four fathoms. It is not more than 500 yards
wide, and runs with great velocity. Its course
is somewhat crooked, but it pursues a southerly
line to the sea, and passes by a fine village on
the left bank called Kelaun. Though the Gora
possesses such facilities for navigation, yet it is
not to be entered from the sea by the smallest
boats, from a dangerous sand bank, to which I
have before alluded. It is clear that such sand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
banks are thrown up by the impetuosity of the
stream; for the Reechel, till it was deserted by
the great body of the Indus, had as large a bar
as is now opposite Gora, which has entirely disappeared
with the absence of the fresh water.
This branch of the Indus in the last century was
open to large boats; and a square-rigged vessel
of 70 tons now lies near it on dry land, where it
has been left by the caprice of the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Khaeer and
Mull.</div>

<p>Below the Gora we have the Khaeer and Mull,
mouths communicating with it. All three disembogue
within twelve miles of each other.
The Khaeer, like the Gora, is unnavigable. The
Mull is safe for boats of 25 tons; and being
the only entrance now open to Shah-bunder, is
therefore frequented. The boats anchor in an
artificial creek four miles up it, called Lipta,
and await the flat-bottomed craft from the port,
distant about twenty miles north-east.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Seer.</div>

<p>About five-and-twenty miles below Mull we
meet the Seer mouth of the Indus, but have
salt instead of fresh water. There are several
minor creeks that intervene, but they do not
form any communication. The Seer is one of
the destroyed branches of the Indus. A dam
has been thrown across it below Mughribee, fifty
miles from its mouth; and though it ceases to
be a running stream on that account, the superfluity
of fresh water from above forces for itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
a passage by small creeks till it regains the Seer,
which thus contains fresh water twenty miles
from its mouth, though it is but a creek of the
sea. The river immediately below Mughribee
is named Goongra; higher up it is called
Pinyaree, and leaves the parent stream between
Hydrabad and Tatta. The Seer is accessible
to boats of 150 candies (38 tons) to a place
called Gunda, where they load from the flat-bottomed
boats of Mughribee. With some extra
labour, these same boats could reach the dam
of Mughribee; and from that town the inland
navigation for flat-bottomed boats is uninterrupted
to the main Indus, though it becomes
more difficult in the dry season. The dam of
Mughribee is forty feet broad. The Seer at
its mouth is about two miles wide, but it gets
very narrow in ascending; within, it has a depth
of four and six fathoms, but below Gunda there
is a sand bank with but one fathom water on it.
There is a considerable trade carried on from
this branch of the Indus with the neighbouring
countries of Cutch and Kattywar; for rice, the
staple of Sinde, is to be had in abundance at
Mughribee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Koree,
or eastern
mouth.</div>

<p>The Koree, or eastern branch of the Indus,
completes the eleven mouths of the river. It
once discharged a portion of the waters of the
Fulailee that passes Hydrabad, as also of a branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
that quits the Indus near Bukkur, and traverses
the desert <i>during the swell</i>; but it has been
closed against both these since the year 1762,
when the Sindians threw up bunds, or dams, to
inflict injury on their rivals, the inhabitants of
Cutch.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Of all the mouths of the Indus the
Koree gives the grandest notion of a mighty
river. A little below Lucput it opens like a
funnel, and at Cotasir is about seven miles wide,
and continues to increase till the coasts of Cutch
and Sinde are not visible from one another.
When the water here was fresh it must have
been a noble stream. The depth of this arm
of the sea (for it can be called by no other
name) is considerable. We had twenty feet of
water as high as Cotasir, and it continues equally
deep to Busta, which is but eight miles from
Lucput. A Company’s cruiser once ascended
as high as Cotasir; but it is considered dangerous,
for there is an extensive sand bank at
the mouth called Adheearee, on which the water
at low tide is only knee deep. There are also
several sand banks between it and Cotasir, and
a large one opposite that place. The Koree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
does not communicate with the Seer or any
other mouth of the Indus, but it sends off a
back water to Cutch, and affords a safe inland
navigation to small craft from Lucput to Juckow
on the Indian Ocean, at the mouth of the gulf
of Cutch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advantages
of
these to
Sinde.</div>

<p>The Sindians, it will therefore appear, have
choked both eastern branches. There being no
communication by the Indus and the Koree, the
trade of Sinde is not exported by it. It finds a
vent by the Seer; but this has not given rise to
any new town being built on its banks. Such,
indeed, is the humidity, that this country is only
tenable for a part of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sea
outside the
Indus; its
dangers.</div>

<p>We here complete the enumeration and description
of the mouths of the Indus. Out
from them the sea is shallow; but the soundings
are regular, and a vessel will have from twelve
to fifteen feet of water a mile and a half off
shore. The Gora bank presents the only difficulty
to the navigation of these coasts, from
Mandivee, in Cutch, to Curachee. Breakers are
to be traced along it for twelve miles. The
sailors clear it by stretching at once out of sight
of land, and keeping in twelve fathoms’ water
till the danger is over: they even state that a
vessel of twenty-five tons would be wrecked on
a course where the depth is ten fathoms. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
bank is much resorted to by fishermen; and it
may generally be distinguished by their boats
and nets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coast of
Sinde
exposed.</div>

<p>The coast of Sinde, from its entire exposure
to the Indian ocean, is so little protected against
storms, that the navigation is much sooner suspended
than in the neighbouring countries.
Few vessels approach it after March; for the
south-west monsoon, which then partially commences,
so raises the sea that the waves break
in three and four fathoms water, while the coast
is not discernible from its lowness till close upon
it, and there is a great risk of missing the port,
and no shelter at hand, in such an event.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tides of
the Indus.</div>

<p>The tides rise in the mouths of the Indus
about nine feet at full moon: they flow and ebb
with great violence, particularly near the sea,
where they flood and abandon the banks with
equal and incredible velocity. It is dangerous
to drop the anchor but at low water, as the channel
is frequently obscured, and the vessel may be
left dry. The tides in the Indus are only perceptible
seventy-five miles from the sea, that is,
about twenty-five miles below Tatta.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Country at
the mouths
of the Indus.</div>

<p>There is not a more miserable country in the
world than the low tract at the mouths of the
Indus. The tide overflows their banks, and
recedes to leave a desert dreary waste, overgrown
with shrubs, but without a single tree.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
If a vessel be unfortunately cast on this coast,
she is buried in two tides; and the greatest despatch
can hardly save a cargo. We had proof
of this in an unfortunate boat which stranded
near us; and, to add to the miseries of this
land, the rulers of it, by a barbarous law, demand
every thing which is cast on shore, and
confiscate any vessel which, from stress of weather,
may enter their ports.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Curachee,
why preferred
to
the Indus.</div>

<p>The principal sea-port of Sinde is Curachee,
which appears remarkable, when its rulers are in
possession of all the mouths of the Indus; but
it is easily explained. Curachee is only fourteen
miles from the Pittee, or western mouth of the
Indus; and there is less labour in shipping and
unshipping goods at it, than to carry them by
the river from Darajee or Shahbunder in flat-bottomed
boats. Curachee can also throw its
imports into the peopled part of Sinde without
difficulty, by following a frequented and good
level road to Tatta. The unshipment, too, at
that port, supersedes the necessity of shifting
the cargo into flat-bottomed boats; and the
actual distance between Curachee and Tatta
(about sixty miles) is half exceeded by following
the windings of the stream to any of the harbours
in the Delta. As the ports in the river
and Curachee are both subject to Sinde, it is conclusive
that that sea-port has advantages over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
those of the river, which have led to their being
forsaken by the navigator. In former years,
before Curachee was seized by the Sindians, the
exports from the Delta were more considerable;
since then all articles of value are brought to
Curachee by land, and there shipped. The
opium from Marwar is never put into a boat
but to cross the Indus on its way to Curachee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sea
boats of
Sinde.</div>

<p>The boats of the Indus claim attention. Including
Curachee and all the ports of the
country, there are not, perhaps, a hundred
dingees, or sea vessels, belonging to the dominions
of the Ameer. These boats are of a
peculiar construction&mdash;of a sharp build, with a
very lofty poop; the large ones never ascend
the rivers, and are principally used at the port
of Curachee, and sail from thence to Muscat,
Bombay, and the Malabar coast: they carry no
guns. A smaller dingee is used at the mouths
of the Indus, chiefly for fishing: they are good
sea-boats, and sail very quickly. The fisheries
in the mouths of the Indus being extensive,
and forming a source of commerce, these craft
abound.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flat-bottomed
boats.</div>

<p>The traffic on the Indus, commencing from
its very mouth, is carried on in flat-bottomed
boats, called doondees. They are large and
unwieldy, and never exceed 100 kurwars (fifty
tons) in burthen, and, when laden, draw only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
four feet of water. They have two masts, the
larger in front; they hoist their sails behind
them, to prevent accident, by giving less play
to the canvass. The foresail is of a lateen
shape; that aft is square, and very large. With
these set, they can stem the current, in a good
wind, at the rate of three miles an hour. We
came from the sea to Hydrabad in five days.
When the wind fails, these boats are dragged,
or pushed up by spars against the stream. With
ropes, they can be pulled a mile and a half in
the hour; and they attach these to the mast-head,
to have a better purchase. The helm is
shaped like the letter P, and in the larger vessels
is managed by ropes from each side; at a distance,
it seems quite detached from the doondee.
These vessels are also furnished with a long
supple oar astern, which they work backwards
and forwards, the steersman moving with it on
an elevated frame. It is possible to impel the
doondee with this oar alone, and nothing else is
used in crossing the different ferries. When
coming down with the stream, this oar, too, is
again in requisition, they work it to and fro,
to keep the broadside of the vessel to the current.
In descending the river, the masts are
invariably struck, and the helm even is stowed
away. I can compare these boats to nothing so
correctly as the drawing of Chinese junks; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
largest are about eighty feet long and eighteen
broad, shaped something like a ship high astern
and low in front, with the hull slanted off at
both ends, so as to present less resistance to
the water. They are floating houses; for the
people who navigate them take their families,
and even their herds and fowls, along with
them. All the boats on the river, large and
small, are of the above description. In navigating
the doondees, the boatmen always choose
the shallow water, and avoid the rapids of the
river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indus
navigable
for steam
vessels.</div>

<p>From the account of the River Indus at its
mouths, which is above given, it will appear
that it would be accessible to steam-boats of a
certain size and build; but I am thoroughly
satisfied that no boat <i>with a keel</i> could ever
navigate this river with any hopes of safety.
The flat-bottomed boats are constantly grounding,
but they sustain no injury; while boats
differently constructed would be at once upset
by the violence of the stream, and destroyed. It
is not to be doubted, however, that steam-vessels
could be adapted to this navigation as well
as the existing boats on the river; and had
not coal been found both at the head and mouth
of the Indus, fuel could be supplied from the
great abundance of wood which the banks of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
river every where furnish. The Americans use
wood for this purpose; and the supply of brushwood
on the Lower Indus is abundant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military
remarks on
the Indus.</div>

<p>I make allusion to the navigation of this river
by steam, because I am aware it is an object
of interest; but, in conducting any expedition
against Sinde, I feel satisfied, from
what I have seen, that there would be little
advantage, in a military point of view, derived
from the river Indus below Tatta. It would
be impracticable to march a force through the
Delta, from the number of rivers; and it would
be equally impossible to embark it in flat-bottomed
boats, for there are not 100 of them
below Hydrabad; few are of burthen, and the
very largest would not contain a company of
infantry. The vulnerable point of Sinde is Curachee,
and a landing might be effected on either
side of the town without difficulty. The Creek
of Gisry, to the south-east, has been pointed
out<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> as a favourable place, and I can add my
concurrence in the opinion; but a force would
easily effect its disembarkation anywhere in
that neighbourhood. For a land expedition,
the route from Cutch to Ballyaree, by the
Thurr, seems to me the most feasible. While I
represent the mouths of the Indus as unfavour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>able
for conducting an attack from India on
Sinde, I do not wish to be understood as hazarding
at this time any opinion on like obstacles
presenting themselves in an attack from its banks
on India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supplies of
the Delta.</div>

<p>With regard to the supplies which an army is
to expect in the lower parts of Sinde, my report
will be more favourable. Grain, that is, rice
and bajree, will be found in great abundance.
Horned cattle and sheep are numerous. The
pasturage is not good, but near the sea abundant.
Almost all the villages are mere hamlets;
for Darajee, Lahory, and Shahbunder, which
figure on the map as places of importance, have
none of them a population of 2000 souls. The
two first, indeed, have not that between them;
and there are not ten other places that have a
hundred souls below Tatta. Camels would be
found in great abundance, as also horses: these
are of a small and diminutive breed, but the camels
are very superior. From the number of buffaloes,
milk and ghee are to be had in great abundance,
and all the rivers abound in fish. The country
is peopled to the sea-shore; but the inhabitants
are thinly scattered over its surface in temporary
villages; and near many of the mouths experience
great inconvenience from the want of
fresh water, which they bring from a distance
for themselves and cattle: the banks of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Gora form the only exception. The people
consist chiefly of erratic and pastoral tribes;
for though the Indus presents such facilities to
the cultivator, there is not a fourth of the cultivable
land below Tatta brought under tillage;
it lies neglected and overgrown with tamarisk.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAP_V">CHAP. V.<br />

<span class="smaller">ON THE DELTA OF THE INDUS.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">Delta of
the Indus.</div>

<p>Herodotus said of Egypt, that it was the
“gift of the Nile;” the same may be said of
the country at the mouths of the Indus. A
section of the banks of the river shows a continued
succession of earth, clay and sand in
layers, parallel to one another; and deposited,
without doubt, at different periods. It would
be perhaps hazarding too much to state, that
the whole of the Delta has been gradually acquired
from the sea; but it is clear that the
land must have greatly encroached on the ocean.
Nothing is more corroborative of this fact than
the shallowness of the sea out from the mouths
of the Indus, and the clayey bottom and tinge
of the water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inundation.</div>

<p>The country from Tatta, which stands at the
head of the Delta, to the sea downwards, is in
most parts influenced by the periodical swell of
the Indus: the great branches of this river are
of themselves so numerous, and throw off such
an incredible number of arms, that the inundation
is general; and in those places which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
denied this advantage by fortuitous circumstances,
artificial drains, about four feet wide
and three deep, conduct the waters through the
fields. The swell commences in the latter end
of April, and continues to increase till July, disappearing
altogether in September: a northerly
wind is supposed to accelerate it. It begins
with the melting of the snow in the Himalaya
mountains, before the rainy season. At other
times the land is irrigated with the Persian
wheel, which is turned by a camel or bullock,
and in general use every where. One eighth of
the Delta may be occupied by beds of rivers and
inferior streams. Ten miles from the sea, the
country is so thickly covered with furze and
bushes, that it is incapable of being brought
under tillage. Close upon the sea coast, however,
there is abundance of green forage, which
furnishes pasture to large herds of buffaloes.
These animals reward the herdsmen with an
abundant supply of ghee; but his labour is incessant,
for he must bring fresh water from the
interior for himself and his herd.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Towns.</div>

<p>In a tract peopled by a pastoral race, there
are few permanent towns or villages. When we
except Darajee, Vikkur, Shahbunder, Mughribee,
and one or two others, the inhabitants
reside in temporary villages called “raj,” which
they remove at pleasure; their huts are con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>structed
of reeds and mats made from rice
straw; each house is surrounded by a grass
“tatty” or fence, to exclude the cold wind and
humid vapours which prevail in this low country,
and are considered noxious. These are the
houses of which Nearchus speaks, and are, I believe,
peculiar to the river Indus. They very
much resemble the huts of tumblers in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Population.</div>

<p>It becomes a difficult matter to form any correct
opinion as to the number of inhabitants in
such a country, where the body of the people
are wanderers, and not confined to narrow limits:
huts are, however, to be seen every where, and,
excluding the city of Tatta, the population of
the Delta cannot be rated at less than 30,000
souls; of this estimate, one third may be composed
of those who reside in the fixed towns.
This census gives seven and a half to the square
mile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tribes.</div>

<p>The erratic tribe, in the Delta of the Indus,
is called Jut; these people are the aborigines of
the country; they are a superstitious race of
Mahommedans, and exceedingly ignorant. The
different banks of the rivers are peopled by
watermen of the tribe of Mooana; they are
emigrants from the Punjab, and are employed
in navigating the boats, or fishing in the sea or
river. There is also another tribe from the same
country, called Seik Lobana, whose occupation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
it is to make reeds and mats. They also kill
wild animals and game, but are held in no
estimation by the rest of the people. Jookeas
or Jukreeas, an aboriginal race from the mountains
over Curachee, are to be found, but they
are not numerous. Some of their chiefs have
land assigned to them. There are also a few
Beloochees. On the fixed population there is
little to remark; it is chiefly composed of
Hindoos, of the mercantile caste, who carry on
the foreign and internal commerce of Sinde.
They do not differ from their brethren in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jokeea
tribe.</div>

<p>The only tribe which calls for further comment,
is that of Jokeea. These people are the descendants
of the Suma Rajpoots, who governed Sinde
in former years. They became converts to the
Mahommedan faith when the Hindoo dynasty
was subverted, and still retain the Hindoo name
of their tribe, and claim consanguinity with the
Jhareja Rajpoots of Cutch. They are mountaineers
from the west bank of the Indus, not
very numerous, and little favoured by the government.
They can bring 2000 men into the
field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fisheries.</div>

<p>The fisheries in the river, and out from its
different mouths, are extensive. They are chiefly
carried on by hooks, and some of the fish caught
are of enormous dimensions. One species called
“Kujjooree” is killed for its sound, which, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
the fins of small sharks that abound near the
Indus, form an article of export to China. The
river fish are likewise abundant; of these, the
most remarkable is the “Pulla,” a kind of carp,
delicious in flavour, and only found in the four
months that precede the swell of the river.
Another species, called the “Singalee,” and
about the size of a small haddock, likewise
abounds. On the approach of the tide, they
make a noise under the ship, louder than a bull
frog. They have a large head, and are very
bony. They exist in all the rivers of Western
India, and are not peculiar to the Indus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Animals.</div>

<p>I am not aware that there are any animals peculiar
to the Delta of the Indus. Otters abound;
camels are numerous, and superior; buffaloes
are reared in great numbers; horned cattle and
sheep are plentiful. The dog, too, is here
elevated to his proper situation, and is an attendant
on man. They watch the flocks, and
are of a ferocious description, and will not allow
a stranger to approach a “raj” or village; they
swim the rivers with great dexterity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Productions.</div>

<p>The staple production of the Delta of the
Indus is rice: it is to be had of many different
kinds, but its value seems to depend chiefly on
its preparation for the market. Bajree and all
other Indian grains are raised. From extensive
plantations of cane, “goor,” a coarse kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
sugar, is produced; which, with wheat, barley,
and moong, are reared by irrigating the fields
from cuts to the river, some months before the
periodical swell, and form what may be called a
second crop. Saltpetre is found in the Delta,
but it is not exported, though formerly an object
of commerce to the East India Company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Climate.</div>

<p>The climate of Lower Sinde is sultry and disagreeable.
The thermometer ranges as high as
90° in March, and though the soil is a rich
alluvium, the dust blows incessantly. The dews
are very heavy and dangerous. It is in every
respect a trying country to the human constitution,
and this was observable in the premature
old age of the inhabitants. I could not
hear of their being subject to any marsh fever,
or other evil effect from the inundation; they
confined their complaints to the inconvenience
and annoyance which they suffered from insects
and musquitoes generated in the mud.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INDUS FROM TATTA TO HYDRABAD.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">Indus from
Tatta to
Hydrabad.</div>

<p>From the city of Tatta, which stands at a distance
of three miles from the river, we cease to
have the Indus separated into many channels.
On the right bank it is confined by low rocky
hillocks of limestone formation; and on the left
there is but one narrow branch, the Pinyaree,
which is accessible to boats from the town of
Mughribee, when the superfluous water of the
floods follows its course to the sea. Yet the
general width of the channel is less than half a
mile; at Hydrabad it is but 830 yards, at Tatta
less than 700, and below the village Hilaya,
fifteen miles from that town, it does not indeed
exceed 600. The greatest depth of water lies
opposite the capital, and is five fathoms; the
least at Tatta, where it is but fifteen feet; generally,
there is a depth of twenty feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its sand-banks.</div>

<p>The Delta of the Indus is free from sand-banks;
from Tatta to Hydrabad, they occur
every where, and, as the sides of the river are
here more frequently shelving than steep, it is
difficult to discover the deep channel, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
perplexes the navigator. Many of these sand-banks
are but knee deep in the water, and are
constantly shifting their position; the current
being less rapid than near the sea, they are not
easily swept away. In several places they have
become islands, and divide the stream into two
channels, one of which will <i>always</i> be found
navigable. This subdivision of the river has
occasioned many of these branches being given
as separate rivers in our maps, but, as I have
before stated, none such exist, excepting the
Pinyaree. In the floods there is a narrow channel
above Triccul, communicating with the
Fulailee branch, which insulates Hydrabad at
that season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Course and
extent.</div>

<p>The distance by land from Tatta to Hydrabad
is less than fifty miles, nor do the windings of
the stream increase it, even by water, to sixty-five.
Its course is south-west by south, and
rather direct, with one decided turn, below
Jurruk, where it throws off the river leading to
Mughribee. We made the voyage against the
stream in two days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Towns, &amp;c.</div>

<p>There are not a dozen places between Tatta
and the capital; the only one of note is Jurruk,
situated near some low rocky hillocks, nor does
it boast a population of 1500 souls: none of
them are fortified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Country.</div>

<p>This country, which might be one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
richest and most productive in the world, is
devoted to sterility. Hunting preserves, or, as
they are called, “shikargahs,” follow one another
in such succession, as to leave no land for tillage;
and the fences which confine the game approach
within a few yards of the Indus. The interior
of these preserves forms a dense thicket, composed
of tamarisk, saline shrubs, and other underwood,
with stunted trees of bramble, which
are not allowed to be pruned or cut; so that
the banks of the Indus, if in the hands of a
formidable enemy, afford cover from which an
expedition conducted by water might be constantly
and grievously harassed. The roads
through this tract are equally close and strong.</p>

<p>Neglected as is this portion of Sinde, it is not
destitute of supply; grain is cheap and plentiful
everywhere. Tatta and Hydrabad are the
ancient and modern capitals of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Productions.</div>

<p>The productions of the soil in the gardens of
Tatta exhibit the fertility of this land: the vine
is successfully reared, as also the fig and the pomegranate.
There are apple-trees in abundance,
and though the fruit is small, it increases in size
about Hydrabad. In the few patches of cultivation
may be seen indigo, tobacco, sugar-cane,
with wheat, barley, and all the other Indian
grains; but it is the policy of the rulers of
Sinde to keep every thing in a state of nature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
that their territories may not excite the cupidity
of surrounding states. Agriculture and commerce
are alike depressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trade.</div>

<p>With regard to the trade of this country, it
may be said there is little or none anywhere
but at Curachee. The Indus is as if it existed
not; and, though grain is sent by it to the delta,
no advantage is taken of the river to convey
goods to Hydrabad. The imports are landed at
Curachee, and the most valuable export, which
is Malwa opium, is shipped from the same port.
The merchants, in prosecuting their journey to
Candahar, and the upper provinces of the Indus,
quit the Sindian territories with all dispatch.
The only encouragement which the chiefs give
to trade is in opium, yet they levy the exorbitant
duty of 250 rupees for a camel-load.
The revenue from this article alone amounted last
year it is said to seven lacs of rupees; a sum equal
to the land revenue of the Hydrabad Ameer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Means of
improving
it.</div>

<p>Nor do there exist any hopes of improving or
increasing commercial intercourse by this river,
till the rulers of it have more just notions of
policy, and some one of them, more enlightened
than the rest, discovers that the true riches
of a country are to be found by encouraging
the people in industry and art. At present
there is no wealth in Sinde but what is possessed
by its rulers; and had the people the in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>clination,
they have not the means of purchasing
the manufactures of Europe. The case was
otherwise in the beginning of this century, when
the East India Company traded at Tatta by a
factory, and the rulers, intimidated by their lord
paramount in Cabool, did not object to the transit
of goods to that and other countries. Sinde
must follow the fate of that portion of Asia; and,
if any of the Dooranee tribes be yet able to
seize the crown of Cabool, we may expect a
change for the better in the dependent provinces
at the mouths of the Indus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boats, deficiency
thereof.</div>

<p>At present there are not vessels sufficient for
any considerable trade: between the capital
and Tatta they do not exceed fifty, many of
them small and used for fishing, others old and
worn out, that cross the stream in certain places
as ferry-boats. Encouragement would soon remedy
what may be considered a defect in a
military, as well as a commercial point of view.
Sinde has no wood for ship building, that which
is used being imported from Malabar.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAP_VII">CHAP. VII.<br />

<span class="smaller">FROM HYDRABAD TO SEHWUN.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">Sehwun, its
position.</div>

<p>The town of Sehwun stands at a distance of two
miles from the west bank of the Indus, and is
exactly 1° of latitude north of Hydrabad, for it
is crossed by the parallel of 26° 22´. The voyage
is performed in eight days, against the stream,
and the distance is 105 miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indus, its
course and
depth.</div>

<p>The river, in this part of its course, is named
“Lar,” which, in the Belooch language, means
south: it flows about S. S. E., being resisted at
Sehwun by rocky mountains, which change the
direction of the stream. Its banks are very
low, and the country bordering on them frequently
overflowed, particularly on the eastern
side: the western bank is more firm, but seldom
exceeds eight feet in height. This expansion of
the river diminishes its general depth to eighteen
feet: during the swell the increase is twelve feet
additional; the width is frequently 1000 yards
and upwards. About six miles above Hydrabad,
the Indus divides into two channels, one of
which is fordable, and the other but 400 yards
wide, which points to this as the place for crossing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
an army. At Sehwun the rocky buttress of the
Lukkee hills hems the waters into a channel of
500 yards; but the depth is nearly forty feet,
and the current rapid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fulailee
River.</div>

<p>The river throws off no branches, in this
part of its course, save the Fulailee, which leaves
the Indus twelve miles above Hydrabad, and
passes eastward of that city: it is only a stream
during the swell. It was dry at Hydrabad when
we were at that city, and but a 100 yards wide,
and knee-deep where it separated from the
Indus; yet it is a very considerable river in the
wet season, and fertilises a vast portion of Sinde
by its water, which it may be said to exhaust
between Hydrabad and Cutch. The maps give
most erroneous ideas of the Indus, for the
numerous branches which appear to leave the
river are only water courses for the periodical
swell, many of them artificial, dug for the purposes
of irrigation. The river for nine months
runs in one trunk to Tatta.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Current,
and effects
of it.</div>

<p>The current never exceeds three miles an
hour in this part of the Indus, unless at some
places where it is confined, when its rapidity
undermines its banks, and carries villages along
with it. The towns of Majindu and Amree, on
the right bank, have both been swept away, the
former no less than eight or ten times within
the last twelve years; but the people retire a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
few hundred yards, and again erect their habitations.
Hala, on the eastern side, has shared a
like fate; but the channel of the river lies to the
westward, where the banks are more steep, and
the left bank of the river, though consisting of
a flat field of sand, is only inundated in the
swell. At that period, for eight miles eastward
of the Indus, it is not possible to travel from
the number of shoots the river casts off. The
Indus itself is here pretty constant in its course;
and, though the country eastward would, as I
have observed, favour the escape of the water
in that direction, it clings for some time to the
Lukkee mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its military
importance.</div>

<p>This section of the river is of great importance:
about two miles below Sehwun these
mountains run in upon the Indus, leaving two
practicable passes over them. The one leads
across a depressed part of the range, called
Buggotora, westward of the village of Lukkee
(which signifies a pass), and might be obstinately
defended: it is not a gun-road. The other
passes between the river and the mountains, and
is a cart-road, running in a valley among the
lower rocks, at the base of the Lukkee mountains.
The ground is very strong for about two
miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crossing
the Indus.</div>

<p>I have before mentioned that the river near
Sehwun is confined to a narrow bed. The right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
bank is very remarkable, consisting of a natural
buttress of solid rock, about fifty feet high,
which extends for 400 yards along the river,
and, slanting upwards, is barely accessible to a
foot passenger. The Indus passes with such a
sweep under the base of this rampart, that,
though but 500 yards wide, I question if a
bridge could be thrown across it. There is a
more favourable place immediately north of this
precipice, where the breadth is but 100 yards
greater, and the water more still. Thirty or
forty flat-bottomed boats would always be found
at Sehwun: they lie on the left bank, which is
flat and sandy. There are good roads from
Sehwun to Hydrabad on both sides of the Indus;
and there is a footpath along the base of the
mountains to Curachee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Navigation
of the
Indus.</div>

<p>The river can only be navigated by dragging
the boat against the stream, for there is very
little wind in the upper parts of Sinde: the progress
by this method is sure, and averages from
fifteen to twenty miles a day. It would be impossible,
without steam, to conduct any military
expedition against the stream of the Indus, for
the labour of dragging the boats would be
great, from constant accidents, by ropes breaking,
and the vessels being hurried into the
stream. The case would be very different in
an army descending the Indus. Trading vessels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
however, would not be liable to any such impediments.
We only counted 180 boats in our
progress from Hydrabad to Sehwun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Towns,
country.</div>

<p>Of the country and towns which intervene
between Sehwun and the capital, a few words
will suffice. There are none of any size but
Sehwun itself: Muttaree, sixteen miles from
Hydrabad, contains 4000 people; and Hala,
Beyan, Majindu, and Sen about 2000 each.
The other places are few, and thinly peopled:
three or four of them have frequently one name.
The country is much neglected, the banks of
the river are, in most places, covered with
tamarisk, towards the hills it is open. Cotton,
indigo, wheat, barley, sugar, tobacco, &amp;c. are
produced by irrigation in the dry season; but
the limited extent of the cultivation may be
discovered, by their being but 194 wells, or cuts,
from the river on one side of the Indus, between
Hydrabad and Sehwun, a distance of 100 miles,
where the greater part of the soil is rich and
cultivable. In a few places the land is salt and
sterile. Rice is only produced during the swell,
and yet provisions are dearer here than in the
neighbouring and less favoured country of Marwar.
The people live chiefly on fish and milk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sehwun.</div>

<p>The town of Sehwun bears alone the marks of
opulence in this portion of Sinde; and it is indebted
for its prosperity to the shrine of a holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
saint from Khorasan, by name Lal Shah baz,
whose tomb is a place of pilgrimage from afar
to Hindoo and Mussulman. A branch of the
Indus, called Arrul, runs immediately past the
town, in its course from Larkhana; but this will
be described in the next chapter. Four years
since, the Indus passed close under Sehwun; but
it has retired, and left a swamp on all sides of
the town. About Sehwun the country is rich
and productive, and the bazar is well supplied.
Looking north, the eye rests on a verdant plain,
highly cultivated, which extends to the base of
the mountains: mulberries, apples, melons, and
cucumbers grow here; the grain crops are
luxuriant, and, for the first time, we saw gram.
The melons are tasteless, I presume from the
richness of the soil: cucumbers grow in Sinde
only at Sehwun. The climate is sultry, oppressive,
and disagreeable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lukkee
mountains.
Runna.</div>

<p>The Lukkee mountains run in upon the Indus
at Sehwun, extending from near the seaport of
Curachee, and gradually encroaching upon the
river, till they meet in a bold buttress. The
elevation of this range does not, I think, exceed
2000 feet; their formation is limestone; the
summits are flat and rounded, never conical:
they are bare of vegetation, and much furrowed
by watercourses, all of which present a concave
turn towards the Indus. There is a hot spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
near Sehwun, at the village of Lukkee, situated
at the base of these mountains, adjoining one of
a cold description: the hot spring is a place of
Hindoo pilgrimage, and considered salutary in
cutaneous disorders. There is a spring of the
same kind in the neighbourhood of Curachee, at
the other extremity of the same range, so that
similar springs would probably be found in the
intervening parts. On this range, and about
sixteen miles westward of Majindu, on the
Indus, stands the fortified hill of Runna, a place
of strength in by-gone years, but, till lately, neglected.
The Ameer of Sinde has repaired it
at considerable expense; but, from what I could
learn, Runna owes its chief strength to the
absence of water from the bleak mountains
which surround it, and the copious supply within
its walls.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAP_VIII">CHAP. VIII.<br />

<span class="smaller">THE INDUS, FROM SEHWUN TO BUKKUR.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">Bukkur, its
position.</div>

<p>The insulated fortress of Bukkur is situated on
a rock in the Indus, between the towns of
Roree and Sukkur. It is a degree and twenty
minutes north of Sehwun, being in latitude
27° 4´; and in longitude it is 56 miles eastward
of that town. The distance by the river amounts
to 160 miles, and we voyaged it in nine days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indus.</div>

<p>Between these points the Indus flows in a
zigzag course, nearly south-west, till it is impeded
by the Lukkee mountains, below Sehwun.
The intervening country is richly watered by
its meanderings, and, from the lowness of the
banks, the tract is disputed by the river and its
ramifications, and formed into numerous islets
of the richest pasture. On the least approach
of the swell, both banks are inundated and irrigated:
the superfluous water often forces for
itself a passage into the desert by Omercote, and
joins the eastern mouth of the Indus or Koree,
which passes Cutch. The channel of this watercourse
commences above Bukkur, and passes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
four miles eastward of that place, the ancient city
of Alore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fertility of
the country.</div>

<p>About twenty-five miles below Bukkur, the
Indus sends to the westward a branch called
Nara, that washes the base of the Hala, or
mountains of Beloochistan, and, after pursuing
a parallel course of many miles, rejoins the river
at Sehwun. Its waters are courted, and distributed
by canals, which add to the blessings
bestowed by nature on this flat and fertile land.
The eastern bank, though less favoured than the
opposite one, is highly cultivated, and most of
the towns and villages stand on the verge of
canals, which bounteously distribute the waters
of the periodical swell, and attest the industry
and assiduity of the inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Current,
depth, &amp;c.</div>

<p>The river but rarely flows here in one undivided
stream; with a width of three quarters
of a mile, in some places, it preserves a depth
of fifteen feet in its shallowest bed. There
is nothing approaching to a ford in any part of
its course: two hundred boats would be found at
the various villages in this part of the river. The
declivity on which the Indus runs to the ocean
must be gentle, for above the delta it glides
sluggishly along at less than two miles and a half
in the hour. From Sehwun upwards, the Indus
is called “Sira,” which means north, in contradistinction
to the southern portion, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
called “Lar.” Mehran is a foreign term, with
which the natives of the country are not acquainted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eastern
bank of the
Indus.</div>

<p>The immediate vicinity of the Indus is alike
destitute of beauty and inhabitants. It is overgrown
with tamarisk shrubs, and the villages are
purposely raised at the distance of two or three
miles, to avoid the calamities of inundation; yet
there were an hundred wheels at work on the
verge of the river. The eastern bank, from
Sehwun to Bukkur, is by far the best peopled
portion of Sinde; but the inhabited places which
do occur are rather numerous and thriving than
large and wealthy: many of them have 500
houses. This territory is subject to the chief
of Khyrpoor, and is enriched by a canal forty
feet broad, called “Meerwah,” which conducts,
by a southerly course, the waters of the Indus
from the neighbourhood of Bukkur to a distance
of ninety miles, where they are lost in sands, or
deposited in the fields. There are numerous
other canals beside the one which I have now
described; and, while their banks are fringed
with villages and agriculture, they likewise afford
the means of transporting, by boats, the produce
of the soil. In the fair season, when dry,
they become the beaten footpaths of the people,
and are excellent cart-roads, preferred at all
times to the common pathway, which, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
exuberance of vegetation in this country, is
generally impeded by bushes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Western
bank of
the Indus.</div>

<p>The western bank of the Indus, which is intersected
by the Nara, is called Chandkoh, from
a Belooche tribe of that name, and yields the
greater portion of the land revenue of the Hydrabad
Ameers. This branch, which leaves the
Indus below Bukkur, in the latitude of Larkhana,
in its passage to the main stream, forms a small
lake, called Munchur, which abounds in fish.
Further down, it changes the name of Nara into
that of Arrul, before falling into the Indus; it
is a narrow river, about 100 yards broad, and
only navigable during the inundation. Numerous
cuts, the chief of which is the Larkhana canal,
extend the cultivation beyond its banks; and, in
addition to the swell of the Indus, this district
is watered by rills from the lofty mountains to
the westward. The lake of Munchur is environed
by fields of wheat in the dry season: its
waters then partially subside, and leave a rich
mould on which good crops are reared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fort of
Bukkur.</div>

<p>The fortress of Bukkur is constructed of
brick, on a low rocky island of flint, at a distance
of 400 yards from the left bank of the Indus,
and about fifty less from the eastern side of the
river. Its walls are loop-holed, and flanked with
towers, that slope to the water’s edge: they do
not exceed twenty feet in height. There is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
gateway on each side of the fortification facing
Roree and Sukkur, and likewise two wickets.
The interior of the works is crowded with houses
and mosques, many of which, as well as parts of
the rock itself, appear above the wall. In shape
it approaches to an oval, and is about 800 yards
long, and 300 in diameter. At some places the
rock has been pared and scraped; but Bukkur
has no strength in its works, and is formidable
only from its position. The garrison consists
of 100 men of the Khyrpoor Ameer: there are
fifteen pieces of artillery, few of which are serviceable.
The walls enclose the entire island,
with the exception of a small date grove on the
northern side, where a landing might be effected
without difficulty, from the right bank, and the
place would fall by escalade; or it might be previously
breached from the bank of the river.
There is a depth of four fathoms on both
sides of the island; but the eastern channel
becomes shallow in the dry season, and is said
to have been once forded. The navigation of
the Indus at Bukkur is dangerous, from eddies
formed under the fortress itself; and several
other rocky islets below it; but the watermen
are considered the most experienced in Sinde,
and, as a boat never attempts to pass up or down
without a pilot, there are but few accidents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Roree and
Sukkur.</div>

<p>The town of Roree, which faces Bukkur,
stands close on the bank of the Indus, on a
flinty precipice forty feet in height, over which
the houses tower. A road cut in the rock, down
to the edge of the river, at a place where it does
not approach the precipice, is the point of embarkation
for those passing to Bukkur; but a
landing would be difficult and dangerous when
the river is high. The town of Roree has about
8000 inhabitants, chiefly Hindoos. To the eastward
of it, several detached hillocks of flint present
a most bleak and barren appearance, but
add to the strength of the country; beyond
their limits a grove of date trees extends for
three or four miles to the southward of the
town, shading numerous orchards and gardens.
Sukkur, which stands opposite Roree, is about
half the size of that town: both have been considerable
places in former years, and the ruins of
minarets and mosques remain. The bank of the
river at Sukkur is not precipitous, and the town
runs in from it, instead of extending, like Roree,
along its banks. These two towns doubtless owe
their position to Bukkur, which, as a protection
in troubled times, added to the courage
and hopes of the inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Khyrpoor
and Larkhana.</div>

<p>The only modern towns of note which require
remark, are Khyrpoor and Larkhana, on the left
and right banks of the river, nearly under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
same parallel of latitude, both distant from it
about fourteen miles, and watered by canals from
the Indus. Khyrpoor is a modern town, built
by the Talpoor chief, Sohrab, who seized on the
northern part of Sinde, after the subversion of
the Caloras. It contains a population of about
15,000 souls, but is merely a collection of mud
hovels heaped together in narrow lanes. It is
destitute of fort or defence, unless a mud wall
about a foot thick, which surrounds the house
of the Ameer and his family, can be considered
in that light. The country near it is flat and
bushy, and a low dyke has been drawn round
the town, to keep the inundations of the river
at a distance. Larkhanu, which stands on the
western bank, is the capital of the Pergunna of
Chandkoh: it has about 10,000 people, and is
the head quarters and rallying point of the Sinde
Ameers on their N. W. frontier. It has a small
mud fort; and an inefficient train of artillery,
about twenty in number, frightens the refractory
in the neighbouring mountains, and maintains
the peace of Sinde. It is governed by a Nuwab,
the individual next in rank to the rulers of the
land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Productions.</div>

<p>The productions of Sinde are very similar in
different parts of the country, and the same
kinds of grain are produced here as at Sehwun.
There is a shrub very like the wall-flower called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
“syar,” that grows in this tract, and the juice of
which is considered a valuable medicine for the
diseases of children. The wheat-fields are
invariably surrounded by a low dyke, like rice
ground: tobacco grows very luxuriantly near
Roree. The greatest want in Sinde is grass,
which is choked by the tamarisk; to which the
people set fire, and derive, by such means,
an abundant crop. There are but few trees in
Sinde; the babool<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, even, does not attain any
considerable size; the neem<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and sirs, so abundant
in India, are rarely seen, and the banian<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
tree is a stranger. The shrubs of the thurr, the
kejra, khair, bair, akra (swallow-wort), and tamarisk,
grow every where. I have already alluded
to the date grove of Roree.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INDUS FROM BUKKUR, TILL JOINED BY THE
PUNJAB RIVERS.</span></h2>

</div>


<div class="sidenote">The Indus.</div>

<p>The waters of the Punjab, united in one stream,
fall into the Indus at Mittun, in the latitude of
28° 55´ north. From this point to Bukkur, the
river pursues a south-westerly course, is direct
in its channel, but frequently divided by sand
banks. Various narrow, crooked branches also
diverge from the parent stream, retaining a depth
from eight to fifteen feet of water, which are
navigated by boats ascending the Indus, in preference
to the great river itself. They extend
throughout the whole intervening space which I
have now under review.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its breadth
and depth.</div>

<p>The Indus is widely spread in many parts of
its course above Bukkur. It often exceeds a
thousand yards in breadth, and at Mittun was
found to be even double that width. The depth
was not proportionally diminished: in some places
it exceeded sixteen fathoms, and four fathoms
were to be found every where; which, it is to be
recollected, was at a season when the waters are
lowest. There was no greater acceleration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
current than in the lower parts of the river,
and the serpentine course of the narrows just
mentioned proves the great flatness of this
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boats of
the Indus.</div>

<p>From Bukkur the Indus is navigated by a
different description of boat from the Doondee,
called “zohruk,” and admirably adapted to the
transport of troops, both horse and foot, from
being as roomy before as astern: they are not
numerous, but we met ninety-five of them in our
voyage to Mittun. We made the passage in these
boats from Bukkur to Mittun in nine days, a
distance of 170 miles by the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Country on
its banks.</div>

<p>The country which this portion of the Indus
traverses is of the richest nature, particularly on
the eastern bank, where it is flooded from innumerable
channels, which are generally cut in
those parts of the river running east and west,
that the water may be thrown south into the interior.
On the right bank, about twenty-six
miles above Bukkur, a navigable canal called
the “Sinde,” the work of the emperors, conducts
a great body of water to Shikarpoor and
Noushera, and joins that of Larkhanu. On
that side of the river the cultivation is limited,
as the districts of Boordgah, Ken, and Moozarka,
which succeed each other, are peopled by wandering
and unsettled Belooche tribes, who lead a
pastoral and plundering life. The territory on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
both sides chiefly belongs to Sinde, for the
boundary line stretches, on the right bank, to
within fifteen miles of Mittun, and adjoining
the dominions of the Seik; but it overlaps that
on the left, which terminates lower down in the
latitude of 28° 33´, twenty-five miles above Subzul.
This stripe of land on the left bank forms
a portion of the territories of the Daoodpootra
chief, Bhawul Khan; and the district immediately
below that chief’s territory in Sinde is named
Oobaro, and inhabited by the Duhrs and Muhrs,
who are the aborigines of the country, and known
by the name of Sindees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shikarpoor,
Subzul,
and other
places.</div>

<p>The town of Shikarpoor, which stands thirty-two
miles from Bukkur, is by far the largest in
this tract, indeed in Sinde, for in size it exceeds
the capital, Hydrabad. The country around it
is very productive, but in the change of masters,
from the Afghans to the Sindians, its revenue
has deteriorated to half a lac of rupees annually:
the government is oppressive. It still carries
on an extensive inland trade, for the greater
portion of its merchants and people are Hindoos,
and have agents in the surrounding countries.
Shikarpoor is surrounded by a mud wall, and
the governor of the place holds an important
post, and with it the title of Nuwab. This town
and district fell into the hands of the Sindians
about eight years ago, and is the only unsettled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
portion of their country, the Afghan family to
whom it belonged making frequent attempts
to recover it. The frontier town of Subzul on
the left bank of the Indus, and twelve miles
inland, is about one fifth the size of Shikarpoor:
it contains a population of 5000 souls, and like
it is surrounded by a mud wall. There are no
other places of note but these which I have
mentioned. Mittun, or, as it is sometimes called,
Mittun Kote, has not a population of 1500
people, and its fort has been demolished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Swell of
the Indus.</div>

<p>It will be observed in this part of its course,
as well as elsewhere, that there are no towns or
places of size in the immediate vicinity of the
Indus; which is owing to the annual swell of
the river rendering it impossible to cultivate or
raise a crop within its reach. This leads to the
waters being conducted inland by canals, the
banks of which being frequently overflowed
render the country untenable. The neighbourhood
of Subzul Kote has been deserted on this
account, and the great quantity of water forces
for itself a channel from this direction upon the
watercourse at Alore. The Indus is very
variable in its rise in different years, and for
these two by-gone seasons has not attained its
usual height.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cattle,
animals, &amp;c.</div>

<p>The number of horned cattle to be seen in
this part of the Indus is exceedingly numerous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
Buffaloes are so plentiful as to be only a fourth
the value of those lower down the river, and the
very best may be purchased for ten rupees each.
Deer, hog, and partridge abound, and the water-fowl
above Bukkur are numerous, even in this
season (May).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tribes bordering
on
the Indus.</div>

<p>I have mentioned the districts lying westward
of the Indus, and the predatory habits of the
inhabitants. The Boordees occupy all the
plains north of Shikarpoor, to the borders of the
Brahooee country, or Cutch Gundava. They
are emigrants from Kej and Mekran, and of the
Belooche family of Rind. They are a fair and
handsome race of men, more like Afghans than
Beloochees: they do not wear the costume of
Sinde, but roll a cloth in folds loosely round
their brows, and allow their hair in long tresses
to hang suspended, which gives them a savage
appearance. They took the name of Boordee,
from a noted individual in the tribe, according
to the Belooche custom, for the various tribes are
nothing more than descendants of some person
of note. The chief place of the Boordees is
Duree, but they have no large towns. The whole
“Oolooss,” or tribe, is rated at 10,000 fighting
men, and till their chiefs were taken into the
service of the Ameers, they were constantly
marauding: petty robberies are yet committed.
Their language is a corrupted Persian: of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
other tribes, the Juttooees, Moozarees, Boogtees,
and Kulphurs, with many more, they differ from
the Boordees only in name. The Juttooees are
to be found in Boordgah: the Moozarees, whose
chief town is Rozan, extend as far as Dera
Ghazee Khan, but their power is now broken,
though they plundered in former times the
armies of Cabool. The Kulphurs and Boogtees
occupy the hills called Gendaree, which
commence below the latitude of Mittun, and
run parallel with the Indus.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INDUS FROM MITTUN TO ATTOK.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">The Indus
above
Mittun.</div>

<p>While on our progress to Mooltan, by the
Chenab or Acesines, I made various enquiries,
and sent different people to acquire precise information,
regarding the Indus above Mittun.
The Cabool mission in 1809 came upon that
river, at Oodoo da Kote, about 100 miles north
of the point in question; and I was desirous of
connecting my own surveys with that place, and
thus complete our knowledge of the Indus from
the sea to Attok.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Description
of it.</div>

<p>The river runs, in this part of its course,
nearly due south, and is free from danger and
difficulty in navigation. It is here generally
known by the name of Sinde or Attok, and traverses
a country much the same as I have described
near Mittun, being often widely spread
from the lowness of its banks. Its breadth is
considerably diminished; for at Kaheree, when
Mr. Elphinstone crossed it in January, the
soundings did not exceed twelve feet, with a
breadth of 1000 yards, while the Indus, after it
has received the Punjab rivers, rolls past Mittun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
with a width exactly twofold. On the left
bank, too, the soundings were found to be four
fathoms deep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Province
of Dera
Ghazee
Khan.</div>

<p>On the right bank of the river the province
of Dera Ghazee Khan occupies the country as
far as the mountains. It is a fertile territory,
and the capital which bears its name is one of
the largest towns on the Indus. It is surrounded
by gardens and date groves, and stands in a
very rich country: it has been long numbered
among the conquests of the Seiks, who farmed
it, till lately, to the Khan of Bhawulpoor at an
annual rent of six lacs of rupees; but as the
district originally produced but four, every
species of extortion was practised which led
to its late resumption. The tract being remote
from Runjeet Sing’s dominions, he is anxious
to hold it without requiring the services of his
troops; and the Maharajah has given Dajil and
some portion of the territory to the Brahooees,
its former owners, on condition of military
service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commerce,
in line of
route.</div>

<p>The productions of Demaun, and the countries
westward of the Indus, are sometimes brought
by Dera Ghazee Khan, and crossed to Ooch;
but the more frequented route lies higher up,
and passing the ferry at Kaheree leads to Mooltan.
The river is not used in the transport of
any portion of the trade, for the hire of boats is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
exorbitant, and it is sent on camels or bullocks.
Madder (called munjoot) is an article of export
from this part of the Indus, and used to dye the
fabrics of Bhawulpoor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Expeditions,
why
they avoided
the
Indus.</div>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the various expeditions
that have been conducted from the
upper provinces of the Indus, to the countries
lower down, have taken the rivers of the Punjab,
as far as they went, in preference to the Indus
itself; but we are certainly not to infer therefrom
that the greater river is shut against navigation.
The conquests of Alexander led him
beyond the neighbourhood of the Indus, and in
the case of the emperors their capital was long
fixed at Lahore, and several of their fleets against
lower Sinde were fitted out at Mooltan, always
a city of great importance in the empire, and on
a river as accessible to the boats of the country
as the Indus itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bridge of
boats at
Attok.</div>

<p>The Indus has been crossed at Attok, and an
account of it, and that fortress, will be found in
Mr. Elphinstone’s work; but the means which
the ruler of Lahore has used of late years to
transport his army to the right bank of the river,
and which I heard from his officers, and afterwards
had confirmed on the spot, deserve
mention. Runjeet Sing retains a fleet of thirty-seven
boats, for the construction of a bridge at
Attok, where the river is only 260 yards wide.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
The boats are anchored in the stream, a short
distance from one another, and the communication
is completed by planks, and covered with
mud: immediately below the fortress of Attok,
twenty-four boats are only required, but at other
places in the neighbourhood, so many as thirty-seven
are used. Such a bridge can only be
thrown across the Indus from November to
April, on account of the velocity of the stream
being comparatively diminished at that season,
and even then the manner of fixing the boats
seems incredible. Skeleton frame-works of
wood, filled with stones, to the weight of 250
maunds (25,000 lbs.), and bound strongly by
ropes, are let down from each boat, to the
number of four or six, though the depth exceeds
thirty fathoms, and these are constantly strengthened
by others to prevent accident. Such a
bridge has been completed in three days, but six
is a more usual period. We are struck with the
singular coincidence between this manner of
throwing up a bridge, and that described by
Arrian<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, when Alexander crossed the Indus.
He mentions his belief regarding Alexander’s
bridge at Attok, and except that the skeleton
frame-works are described as “huge wicker-baskets,”
the modern and ancient manner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
crossing the river appears to have been the
same. The Afghans farmed the construction
of a bridge at Attok for the sum of 14,000
rupees; but the Seik has put a stop to the ruin
of habitations and houses which it invariably
caused, and keeps up an efficient supply of
materials. An army which does not exceed
5000 men is crossed at Attok by the ferry boats
with less labour than by a bridge.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CHENAB OR ACESINES JOINED BY THE
SUTLEGE OR HESUDRUS.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">Chenab or
Acesines.</div>

<p>The Acesines of the Greeks, or the modern
Chenab, is lost in the Indus at Mittun, having
previously gathered the waters of the Punjab
rivers. The junction is formed without noise or
violence, for the banks are depressed on both
sides, and the river is expanded: an eddy is cast
to the eastern side, which sinks the water below
the usual level, but it does not occasion danger.
The Euphrates and Tigris, when joined, pass to
the ocean under the name of the “river of the
Arabs,” and the appellation of Punjnud, or “the
five rivers,” has been bestowed on this portion
of the Chenab; but it is a designation unknown
to the people living on its banks, and adopted,
I conclude, for geographical convenience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Joined by
the Sutlege.</div>

<p>Under the parallel of 29° 20´ north latitude,
and five miles above Ooch, the Chenab receives
the Garra, or joint stream of the Beas and Sutlege
(Hyphasis and Hesudrus of antiquity).
This junction is also formed without violence,
and the low banks of both rivers lead to constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
alteration in the point of the union, which, but
a year ago, was two miles higher up. This circumstance
renders it difficult to decide on the
relative size of these rivers at their junction;
both are about 500 yards wide, but the Chenab
is more rapid. Immediately below the confluence,
the united stream exceeds 800 yards; but in its
course to the Indus, though it expands sometimes
to a greater size, the Chenab rarely widens to
600 yards. In this part of its course it is likewise
subject to change. The depth is greatest
near its confluence with the Indus, exceeding
twenty feet, but it decreases in ascending the
river to about fifteen. The current is swifter
than the Indus, running at the rate of three and
a half miles an hour. The Chenab has some
sand banks, but they do not interrupt its navigation
by the “zohruks,” or flat-bottomed boats,
forty of which will be found between Ooch and
Mittun, a distance of forty miles, and a five days’
voyage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Banks of
the Chenab.</div>

<p>The banks of the Chenab seldom rise three
feet above the water’s edge, and they are more
open and free from thick tamarisk than the
Indus. Near the river there are green reeds,
not unlike sugar-cane, and a shrub called
“wahun,” with leaves like the beech-tree, but
the country is highly cultivated, and intersected
by various canals. The soil is slimy, and most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
productive: the crops are rich, and the cattle
large and abundant; the villages are exceedingly
numerous, and shaded by lofty trees. Some
of these are the temporary habitations of pastoral
tribes, who remove from one place to another,
but there are many of a permanent description
on both banks. Their safety is nowise affected
by the inundations of the river or those of the
Indus, for the expansion of these has been exaggerated,
and it rarely extends two miles from
the banks of either river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ooch, its
productions,
&amp;c.</div>

<p>The only place of note on the Chenab, below
its junction by the Garra, is Ooch. It stands
four miles westward of the river, and no doubt
owes its site to the junction of two navigable
streams in the vicinity. The country around it
is highly cultivated: the tobacco plant in particular
grows most luxuriantly; and after the
season of inundation, the tract is one sheet of
green fields and verdure. The productions of
the gardens are various; the fig, vine, apple, and
mulberry, with the “falsa,” which produces an
acid berry, may be seen, also the “bedee mishk”
(odoriferous willow). Roses, balsams, and the
lily of the valley, excite a pleasing remembrance,
and there are many plants foreign to
India. A sensitive shrub, called “shurmoo,” or
“the modest,” particularly struck me: its leaves,
when touched, close and fall down upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
stalk, as if broken. The mango does not attain
perfection in this soil or climate, and seems to
deteriorate as we advance north. Indigo is
reared successfully. Wheat and other grains are
cultivated in preference to rice, which does not
form here, as in Sinde and the lower provinces of
the Indus, the food of the people, though it may
be had in great quantities.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAP_XII">CHAP. XII.<br />

<span class="smaller">ON BHAWUL KHAN’S COUNTRY.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">Its extent.</div>

<p>The small territory eastward of the Indus,
which lies between the confines of the chief of
Lahore and the Ameers of Sinde, belongs to
Bhawul Khan Daoodpootra. His frontier to the
north may be loosely said to be bounded by the
Sutlege, or Garra, but at Bhawulpoor it crosses
that river, and, running westward to a place
called Julalpoor, comprises a portion of the
country between the Sutlege and Acesines, the
Acesines and the Indus. The Rajpoot principality
of Beecaneer bounds it to the east. It
has Jaysulmeer to the south, and, on that part
where it approaches Sinde, a tract of four miles
in either country is left without tillage, to prevent
dispute on the marches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its nature.</div>

<p>The greater part of this country is a barren
waste of sand-hills. In the vicinity of the
rivers, the tract is rich and fertile, watered,
like the other banks of the Indus, by the annual
swell. The towns are few in number, and
scantily distributed, but there are numerous
hamlets on the Acesines. Bhawulpoor, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
stands on the left bank of the Sutlege, has a
population of about twenty thousand people, and
is the mercantile capital; the walled town of
Ahmedpoor, further south, and about half the
size, is the residence of the chief, as it lies
closer to Durawul, an ancient fort in the desert
(without a town), and the only place of strength
in the country. Durawul is mentioned in the
histories of Sinde as a fortress worthy of Alexander:
it was taken by Mirza Shah Hoosein, in
the year of the Hejira 931; but an account of
the siege proves its position to have been more
formidable than its strength: it is built of brick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Power and
importance.</div>

<p>The influence of the chief of Bhawulpoor is
as limited as his territory, his power having been
crushed by the Seiks, and only saved from
entire overthrow by a treaty, which prevents
Runjeet Sing from crossing the Sutlege. The
revenues do not exceed ten lacs annually (excluding
Dera Ghazee Khan; which, properly,
belongs to the Seik), three of which are demanded
in tribute by the Lahore chief, for his
lands north of the Sutlege; yet Bhawul Khan
maintains some state, and has about two thousand
regular troops (such as they are), with a train of
artillery, to second the efforts of his feudatories
in the field; and his forces collected would
exceed twenty thousand men. The present chief
inherited a large patrimony in treasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Daoodpootras,
their
descent.</div>

<p>The Daoodpootras are a tribe of Mahommedans
from the district of Shikarpoor, on the
right bank of the Indus, which they held in the
earlier part of Aurungzebe’s reign. They crossed
the river, and achieved, by daring acts of bravery,
the conquest of the lands now held by them,
from the Duhrs, Muhrs, and other Sindee tribes,
and have been settled in Bhawulpoor for five
generations. As the name Daoodpootra implies,
they are descendants of one Daood or David; but
the chiefs claim a lineage from the holy line of
Abbas, the uncle of Mahommed. The chiefs of
the tribe are named Peerjanee, and the common
people Kihranee. The community are not allowed
to assert their right to the same holy
descent as their masters, which casts some doubt
on the lustre of their parentage. The whole
tribe does not exceed fifty thousand souls. They
are a fair and handsome race of people, but disfigured
by long bushy tresses of hair, which they
allow to hang over their shoulders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reigning
family.</div>

<p>Bhawulpoor was tributary to Cabool as long
as that kingdom lasted; and the chief had the
title of Nawab, but was nearly independent.
The three last rulers have taken the name of
Bhawul Khan, from a saint of great repute in
Mooltan; and the designation of Nawab has
been changed to that of Khan, by which title
he is familiarly known to his subjects. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
present Bhawul Khan is about thirty years old,
and much beloved by his people: he has a turn
for mechanics, and gives great encouragement
to trade and agriculture. He succeeded, about
five years ago, to the prejudice of his elder
brother, who now holds an office under him;
his power is firmly fixed, and he has a family of
three sons. The form of government is despotic,
and there is no chief of any great importance
in the country but the Khan himself; and the
style and formality of his court keep even these
humble, and at a respectful distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trade of
Bhawulpoor.</div>

<p>The manufactures of Bhawulpoor consist of
loongees, which are celebrated for the fineness
of their texture. The weavers are Hindoos, a
numerous class in this country, and who enjoy
more toleration in their trade than their religion.
The merchants of Bhawulpoor deal
extensively in goods of European manufacture,
which they receive from Pallee, in Marwar, by
way of Beecaneer and the desert, and send into
the Dooranee country by the route of Mooltan
and Leia, crossing the Indus at Kaheree. The
Hindoos of Bhawulpoor, and, indeed, of all this
country, are a most enterprising race of men:
they often travel to Balkh and Bokhara, and
sometimes to Astracan, for purposes of commerce:
they take the route of Peshawur, Cabool,
and Bamean, and, crossing the Oxus, exchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
at Bokhara the productions of India, for that
quarter of Asia and Russia, which are annually
brought by the merchants of that country. They
spoke highly of the Uzbek King, and praised
Dost Mahommed, of Cabool, for the protection he
afforded to trade. The Sutlege, or, rather, the
joint stream of it and the Beas, called Garra,
on which Bhawulpoor stands, is a navigable
river, though not used in the transport of its
merchandise. It does not lie, however, on any
available line of route, except that of Sinde; from
which country, as I have before repeated, there
is no trade with the upper provinces of the Indus.
Of the name of this river, the Beas, I may add,
that it is a contraction of Bypasa, in which we
have nearly all the letters of Hyphasis, the designation
of it found in the ancient authors.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PUNJAB.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">Extent of
Runjeet
Sing’s territory.</div>

<p>The territories of Maha Rajah Runjeet Sing
stretch from the Sutlege to the Indus, from
Cashmere to Mooltan, and comprise the whole
of the countries watered by the Punjab, or five tributary
rivers, eastward of the Indus. The power
of the Maha Rajah over this tract of country
is consolidated: he commands the fastnesses of
the mountains, and its alluvial plains. So entirely
has the Seik nation altered its constitution,
under this chief, that, within a period of twenty
years, it has passed from a pure republic to an
absolute monarchy. The genius of one man has
effected this change, though contending with
powerful opposition, from a religion, that inculcates,
above every other, democracy and the
equality of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Changes in
the Seik
government.</div>

<p>This change of habits has been general, and
the fortunate prince who achieved it, is not more
pre-eminent among his nobles, than they are
among their followers; from whom they receive
a respect bordering on veneration. We have
now no convocations at Umritsir, the sacred city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
of the Seiks, where the affairs of the state were
discussed and settled, and none of the liberty
which the followers of Gooroo Govind proudly
claimed as the feature of distinction in their
tribe. It is evident that the change will affect
the energies of the Seik nation, for they sprang
from a religion which was free from the worn-out
dogmas of Hindooism, and the deteriorated
Mahommedanism of their neighbours, the Euzoofzyees:
their bravery was coeval with that
religion, and based upon it; their political greatness
sprang from their change of faith, and
though that has been changed, the Seiks are yet
left with peculiar tenets, and continue to all intents
and purposes a distinct people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Policy of
Runjeet
Sing, and
state of his
army.</div>

<p>The power which Runjeet Sing acquired has
been preserved by his policy: he has a disciplined
army of infantry, with a due proportion of
cavalry and artillery. The system is unpopular
in the country, and the Seik Sirdars view with
distrust the innovation, and the innovators. The
French officers, when deprived of their patron,
would find it necessary to stand aloof, from
motives of personal safety; and, if they left the
country, the wreck of their labours would soon
perish in the general tumult. At present their
battalions manœuvre with regularity and precision:
they are well accoutred and dressed, but
destitute of the most essential quality of a soldier,&mdash;discipline.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
Their payment is irregular: they
undergo cheerfully the mechanical duties of the
soldier, and have shown their gallantry on
service; but there is no tie between the army
and the government, and the greater and more
glorious victories of the Maha Rajah were
achieved before he had regular troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seik Sirdars,
or chiefs.</div>

<p>The Sirdars of the Seik nation lose their power
in their own feuds. Runjeet has not failed to
foment these, and turn them to advantage; and,
as a mediator of differences, he has always despoiled
both parties to aggrandise himself: he
considers it justifiable to profit by the vices and
bad qualities of human nature, and cares not how
much he promises, and how little he fulfils. The
Maha Rajah, however, has portioned out, with a
liberal hand, the lands and conquests among his
Sirdars, and conciliated them by this means;
few of them place any reliance on his character:
they are aware of his power, and dread
to give him offence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revenues
of the
Punjab.</div>

<p>The revenues of the Punjab and its dependencies
amount to about two and a half crores
of rupees annually: the principal item in this
sum is derived from Cashmere, which furnishes
thirty-six lacs of rupees. I may add,
that all the jagheers and revenues of religious
persons are included in the net sum I have
named. The revenue is collected by arbitrary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
exactions, at the will of the collector, as in other
native governments. They are presumed, at the
outset, to be dishonest, and, aware of the fact,
rifle the peasant, and are prepared to be rifled in
return. The exactions, as regulated by Runjeet
himself, are mild, and his late acquisitions about
Mooltan are in a most prosperous condition.
Cashmere, on the other hand, is described as the
very essence of bad government: the people are
oppressed, and the Maha Rajah is afraid to trust
other but menial servants with that valuable
ornament of his crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revenues
might be
increased.</div>

<p>The revenues of the Punjab might be increased
by annexing to it the provinces <i>immediately</i>
westward of the Indus, some of which
have been subdued by Runjeet Sing; but he
has shown, in this instance, his usual foresight
and discrimination. Across the Indus, he would
encounter a most fanatical people, the Euzoofzyees,
who would occupy the time of his army;
he contents himself, therefore, with an annual
tribute of some horses and rice from Peshawur.
Lower down the Indus, he farms the province
of Dera Ghazee Khan to the Khan of Bhawulpoor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military
resources.</div>

<p>The military resources of the Punjab are great:
it yields more grain than is sufficient for the
consumption of its inhabitants; but the scarcity
of population prevents the full measure of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
production. Camels, mules, horses, and cattle
abound, and all of them, except the cattle, which
are small, are of a superior description. The
roads, from one extremity of the country to the
other, admit of wheeled carriages, except among
the mountains: the Indus, and all the other
rivers are navigable, though not navigated. They
have ferry-boats in abundance, and there are
also materials for their further construction;
these rivers are frequently passed on skins, but
these are more in use among the mountains than
the plains.</p>

<p>The paucity of Seiks, in a country ruled and
governed by them, is remarkable. The mother
earth of the tribe is the “doab,” between the
Ravee and Sutlege; but there are few of them
to be found thirty miles below Lahore. There
are no Seiks westward of the Hydaspes; and to
the eastward of Lahore, where they are said to
predominate, they do not certainly compose a
third of the population. The Punjab, indeed, is
a poorly peopled country, in proportion to its
fertility, though it is probable that it has increased
in population under the present ruler.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAP_XIV">CHAP. XIV.<br />

<span class="smaller">THE CHENAB, OR ACESINES, JOINED BY THE
RAVEE, OR HYDRAOTES.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">The Chenab
described.</div>

<p>The Acesines is the largest of the Punjab rivers,
but its size has been exaggerated. Ptolemy informs
us that it is fifteen furlongs wide in the
upper part of its course; and Arrian states that
it surpasses the Nile when it has received the
waters of the Punjab falling into the Indus by a
mouth of thirty stadia. Alexander warred in
the rainy reason, when these rivers are much
swollen, and when the inundation had set in
for two months. We have already exposed the
latter part of this amplification, in confining
the Chenab to a breadth of 600 yards, and a
depth of twenty feet. There is no perceptible
diminution in the size of this stream, from the
Sutlege upwards, for that river increases the
depth without adding to the breadth; and the
Chenab, south of the Ravee, will be found, as I
have before described it, only with the shallow
soundings of twelve feet. Its banks are so low,
that it is in some places spread as much as 1200
yards, and looks as large as the Indus. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
Mooltan ferry it was 1000 yards across, and
below its junction with the Ravee, above three
quarters of a mile; but these are exceptions to
the general feature of the stream.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its banks,
&amp;c.</div>

<p>The Chenab receives the Ravee, or Hydraotes,
below Fazilpoor, under the parallel of 30° 40´
north latitude, nearly 180 miles from Ooch, by
the windings of the river, and upwards of 53
miles from Mooltan; in the neighbourhood
of which city it passes on its course to the Indus,
by a direction about south-west.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The redness
of its water has already been mentioned, and
that of the Ravee has even a deeper tinge. It
runs quicker than the Indus, or any of the Punjab
rivers, and its banks on both sides are open and
richly irrigated by larger canals of running water,
dug with great labour; on the right bank, from
Mooltan upwards, there is a desert of low sand-hills,
which does not admit of cultivation, and
presses in upon the cultivated land at the short
distance of two miles from the river. It is a
mistake to believe that this desert commences so
low as Ooch, and occupies the “doab” of the
Indus and Acesines; for that tract has many
large villages, and is rich and fertile across from
one river bank to the other. The distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
between the two rivers is about twenty-five
miles, nor does it become desert till it widens beyond
that space below Mooltan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boats of
the Acesines.</div>

<p>At Mooltan the Acesines is navigated by the
“zohruk;” but the vessel differs in some degree
from that used in the Daoodpootra country: the
waist is little more than a foot above water;
they are much smaller, and hoist a mat-sail on a
small mast. As there is no trade, ferry-boats
are only to be had, if we except the few which
bring down salt from the Jelum or Hydaspes.
We embarked in a fleet of ten boats, while such
an additional number are not to be procured on
this part of the river.


<span class="sidenote">Wood, &amp;c.</span>
These vessels are built
of the dyar, or cedar wood from the mountains
in which the Punjab rivers have their
source: the supply which the inundation roots
up and floats down, is sufficient for all purposes,
without any one carrying on a professed trade in
it. While the boats here are constructed of this
wood, they are repaired with the “talee” tree,
which may be found near every village; and,
though this country is not well wooded, an
army might soon procure a supply by cutting
trees from the villages near the river, and floating
them down to any place of rendezvous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crossing
the river.</div>

<p>The natives of this country cross the rivers
without boats, on skins or bundles of reeds; and
whole families may be seen passing in this ap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>parently
insecure mode. I have observed a
man, with his wife and three children, in the
middle of the stream, the father on a skin
dragging his wife and children, who were seated
on reeds, and one of them an infant at the breast:
goods, clothes and chattels form a bundle for
the head; and though alligators do certainly exist,
they are not numerous, or such as to deter the
people from repeating an experiment, to say the
least of it, not free from danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">District of
Mooltan.</div>

<p>The greater part of the country bordering on
this part of the Acesines is included in the district
of Mooltan, which, besides the city of that
name, contains the modern town of Shoojurabad.
The government, when tributary to Cabool, has
been described in the worst terms; but Runjeet
Sing has recruited its population, repaired the
canals, and added to their number, raising it to a
state of opulence and prosperity to which it had
been long a stranger. The soil amply repays
the labour, for such is its strength, that a crop
of wheat, before yielding its grain, is twice
mowed down as fodder for cattle, and then ears,
and produces an abundant harvest. The indigo
and sugar crops are likewise rich, and one small
strip of land five miles long, which we passed,
afforded a revenue of 75,000 rupees. The total
revenue amounts to about ten lacs of rupees a
year, or double the sum it produced in 1809.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
The tobacco of Mooltan is celebrated; but, for
an Indian province, the date-tree is its most singular
production. It yields a great abundance
of fruit, which is hardly inferior to that of
Arabia; for the trees are not weakened by extracting
a liquor from them, as in Lower India. I
imagine that they owe their maturity to the
great heat of Mooltan; for dates seldom ripen in
India. The mangoes of Mooltan are the best of
Upper India, and their good qualities seem also
to arise from the same cause, as the mango
is usually but an indifferent fruit beyond the
tropics.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAP_XV">CHAP. XV.<br />

<span class="smaller">THE RAVEE, OR HYDRAOTES, BELOW LAHORE.</span></h2>
</div>



<div class="sidenote">The
Ravee.</div>

<p>The Ravee is the smallest of the five Punjab
rivers, but, in connection with them and the
Indus, forms a navigable channel from the sea
to Lahore. It joins the Chenab in the latitude
of 30° 40´ north, near the small village of Fazil
Shah, by three different mouths, all of which have
eight feet of water. From Lahore downwards,
the Ravee preserves a breadth of about 150
yards, and, as its banks are high and firm, there
are but few places where it is more expanded.
This river is so winding, that sails cannot be
hoisted, and a day’s voyage often gives but a
direct progress of three or four miles, when the
turnings of the river have been sixfold. Lahore
is only 175 miles from the mouth of the Ravee,
but, by the river, the distance exceeds 380
British miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its navigation.</div>

<p>The Ravee is fordable in many places during
eight months in the year, but its general depth
is about twelve feet, and I am satisfied that a
vessel drawing four or five feet of water could
navigate this river. The boats of the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
do not draw more than two or three, but they
are the common flat-bottomed craft already described.
There is no obstruction to these vessels
in any season of the year, yet the Ravee is not
used by the merchants, and the boats are only
built for purposes of ferrying. Below Lahore
there are fifty-two of them, we ascended in
these vessels, none others being procurable.
The voyage occupied twenty-one days, and was
exceedingly tedious. I am disposed to think
that it is the extreme crookedness of the river
which prevents its being navigated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peculiarities
of the
Ravee.</div>

<p>The Ravee is a foul river, much studded with
sand banks, many of which are dangerous quicksands.
The zigzag course it pursues, bespeaks
the flat nature of the country it traverses; its
banks are more firm and decided than those
of the Indus, or any other of the Punjab rivers.
Near Lahore, they rise sometimes to a perpendicular
height of forty feet; in many places
they attain half that elevation, and give to the
river much the appearance of a canal. The
country bordering on the Ravee is little liable
to be flooded; and it is worthy of remark,
that there are no cuts from this river, for the
purposes of agriculture, below Lahore. Its
current is something less than three miles an
hour. The water is of a reddish colour, like
the Chenab; but it is liable to change, as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
remarked in our voyage, from the fall of rain in
the mountains. This river is sometimes called
Iräoty, in which we recognise the Hydraotes of
the Greeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Towns, and
their inhabitants.</div>

<p>The banks of the Ravee are open, and peopled
from its mouth upwards; but the villages, for half
the distance to the capital, are of a temporary
description, the moveable hamlets of the pastoral
tribe before mentioned, called Jun or Kattia.
From Futtipoor they are numerous, and the
country is cultivated; but the space below that
town is uncultivated. The tract between the
Ravee and Sutlege is of the same sterile and
unproductive description as on the northern side
of the river towards the Hydaspes. Saltpetre
is manufactured in considerable quantities on
both sides of the Ravee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lahore.</div>

<p>Lahore is the only town of note on the banks
of the Ravee, but the river has lately forsaken
its immediate vicinity, and this ancient capital
now stands on a small branch. The position of
Lahore is good, in a military and commercial
point of view. It is equidistant from Mooltan,
Peshawur, Cashmeer, and I may also add Delhi.
It stands in a most fertile country; and an
army of 80,000 men has been supported on the
resources of its neighbourhood, while the people
assert that provisions have not increased with
the increased demand. The city now contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
about 80,000 inhabitants. It is surrounded by
a strong brick wall and ditch, that may be
flooded from the river. There are twelve gates,
and as many semicircular outworks. It could
not withstand a siege, from the density of its
population; but might afford security against
irregular troops. Umritsir is superior in size
and strength to Lahore: it is a mud fortification
of great thickness, and about seven miles in
circumference, and also protected by the strong
citadel of Govindghur. It has a population of
about 100,000 souls. Tolumba is a small town
near the estuary of the Ravee, with a population
of about 1500 people. It has a weak brick fort
of a circular shape, and stands in a thick grove
of date trees two miles south of the river.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[I cannot introduce more appropriately than on the
present occasion, the following paper, which was drawn
up some time since. It is necessary to mention this
circumstance, as a few of the facts communicated are
already before the public, and have been noticed by
Professor Lyell.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Of the Run of Cutch I am not
aware of any other account having been published,
though it is a tract without parallel on the globe.]</p>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">Cutch, its
position.</div>

<p>In the north-western extremity of our Indian
possessions, and under the tropic, is situated
the small and sterile territory of Cutch, important
to the British from its advanced position,
but of more attraction to the student of
history, from its western shore being washed by
the waters of the classic Indus. Cutch is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
country peculiarly situated.&mdash;To the west, it
has the inconstant and ever-varying Indus; to
the north and east, the tract called Run, which
is alternately a dry sandy desert and a muddy
inland lake; to the south, it has the Gulf of
Cutch and the Indian Ocean, with waters receding
yearly from its shores.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alterations
in its
western
coast by an
earthquake.</div>

<p>The physical geography of such a province
is full of interest; for, besides the alteration in
its fluctuating boundaries, it is subject to earthquakes,
one of which has lately produced some
unlooked for changes in the eastern branch
of the Indus. To particularly detail and explain
these, is the object of the present memoir.


<span class="sidenote">Former
fertility.</span>

Cutch at present labours under disadvantages
inflicted on it by the vindictive hatred of a
jealous and cruel neighbouring Government.
Previous to the battle of Jarra, in the year 1762<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>,
the eastern branch of the Indus, commonly
called the Phurraun, emptied itself into the sea
by passing the western shores of Cutch; and the
country on its banks participated in the advantages
which this river bestows throughout its
course. Its annual inundations watered the soil,
and afforded a plentiful supply of rice; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
country on its banks being then known by the
name of “Sayra.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sindians
destroy it,
by damming
the
eastern
branch of
the Indus.</div>

<p>These blessings, which nature had bestowed
on this otherwise barren region, perished with
the battle of Jarra; for the Sindian chief, irritated
at the unsuccessful result of his expedition, returned
to his country full of vengeance, and
inflicted the deepest injury on the country which
he had failed to humble. At the village of
Mora he threw up a mound of earth, or, as it
is called, a “bund,” across that branch of the
Indus which fertilised Cutch, and by thus
turning the stream, which so much benefited its
inhabitants, to flow into other branches of the
river, and by leading it through canals to desert
portions of his own dominions, he at once destroyed
a large and rich tract of irrigated land,
and converted a productive rice country, which
had belonged to Cutch, into a sandy desert.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Injury of
the “bund”
or dam, on
the tract
near.</div>

<p>The mound which had been raised, did not
entirely exclude the water of the Indus from
Cutch; but so impeded the progress of the
main stream, that all agriculture depending on
irrigation ceased. In process of time this trivial
remnant of prosperity disappeared, and the
Talpoors, who succeeded the Kaloras in the
government of Sinde, threw up other mounds;
and about the year 1802, the erection of one at
Ali Bunder excluded the waters of the Indus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
even at the period of inundation, from the
channel which had once conveyed them past
Cutch to the sea. Since then, the stripe of land
which once formed the fertile district of Sayra
ceased to yield a blade of vegetation, and became
a part of the Run of Cutch, on which it had
formerly bordered. The channel of the river
at the town of Lucput shallowed<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>; and, above
Sindree, filled with mud, and dried up. Lower
down it changed into an arm of the sea, and was
flooded at every tide.</p>

<p>The Raos, or Princes of Cutch, possessed at
one time military stations in three different
places of Sinde,&mdash;Budeenu, Ballyaree, and Raomaka-bazar,&mdash;yet
they submissively bore these
indignities, as well to their own detriment as that
of their subjects. They used no exertion to
recover that which nature had bestowed on their
country, or to wipe off those injuries which had
been offered, at variance, as they no doubt were,
with the law of nations, which requires “that
different nations ought, in time of peace, to do
one another all the good they can, and in time
of war, as little harm as possible, without prejudice
to their own real interests.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Earthquake
of
1819 overwhelms
Sindree:
forms a
lake.</div>

<p>In this state of indifference, there occurred, in
June, 1819, a severe shock of an earthquake, by
which some hundreds of the inhabitants of Cutch
perished, and every fortified stronghold in the
country was shaken to its foundations. Wells
and rivulets without number changed from
fresh to salt water; but these were trifling
alterations, compared with those which took
place in the eastern branch of the Indus, and the
adjacent country. At sunset, the shock was felt
at Sindree, the station at which the Cutch
Government levied their customs, situated on the
high road from Cutch to Sinde, and on the banks
of what had been once the eastern branch of the
Indus. The little brick fort of 150 feet square,
which had been built there for the protection of
merchandise, was overwhelmed by an inundating
torrent of water from the ocean, which spread
on every side, and, in the course of a few hours,
converted the tract, which had before been hard
and dry, into an inland lake, which extended for
sixteen miles on either side of Sindree. The
houses within the walls filled with water, and
eight years afterwards I found fish in the pools
among them. The only dry spot was the place
on which the bricks had fallen upon one
another. One of four towers only remained,
and the custom-house officers had saved their
lives by ascending it, and were eventually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
transported to dry land by boats on the following
day.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Raises up a
mound
called
“Ullah
bund.”</div>

<p>But it was soon discovered that this was not
the only alteration in this memorable convulsion
of nature; as the inhabitants of Sindree observed,
at a distance of five miles northward, a mound
of earth or sand, in a place where the soil was
previously low and level. It extended east and
west for a considerable distance, and passed
immediately across the channel of the Indus,
separating as it were for ever the Phurraun river
from the sea. The natives called this mound
by the name of “Ullah bund,” or the mound of
God, in allusion to its not being, like the other
dams of the Indus, a work of man, but a dam
thrown up by nature.</p>

<p>These wonderful events passed unheeded by
the inhabitants; for the deep injury which had
been inflicted on Cutch in 1762 had so thoroughly
ruined that part of the country, that it was a
matter of indifference whether it continued a
desert, or became an inland lake. A feeble and
unsuccessful attempt was made by Cutch to
establish a Custom-house on the newly raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
dam of “Ullah bund,” but to this the Ameers of
Sinde objected, and Sindree being no longer
tenable, the officers were withdrawn to the mainland
of Cutch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An overflow
of the
Indus destroys
it in
1826.</div>

<p>Matters continued in this state till the month
of November, 1826, when information was received
that the Indus had burst its banks in
Upper Sinde, and that an immense volume of
water had spread over the desert which bounds
that country to the eastward, had likewise burst
every artificial dam in the river, as well as the
“Ullah bund,” and forced for itself a passage
to the Run of Cutch.


<span class="sidenote">Actual
state of the
river.</span>
In March, 1827, I
proceeded to investigate the truth of what I
have stated, to examine the natural mound,
and to endeavour to account for these constant
alterations in physical geography. I journeyed
from Bhooj, the capital of Cutch, to Lucput,
a town on the north-western extremity of the
province, situated on the Koree, or eastern
branch of the Indus. Here I embarked in a
small flat-bottomed boat, and sailed up the river.
At Lucput, and for twelve miles up, it was
about 300 yards wide, and from two to three
fathoms deep, retaining all the appearance of a
river. At Sundo, a sand bank so called, which is
about four leagues distant from that town, the
channel shallowed to four or five feet, for two miles;
but then regaining its depth, I entered on a vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
inland lake that bounded the horizon on all sides,
amid which the remaining tower of Sindree
stood, like a rock in the ocean. At Sundo
the water was brackish, at Sindree it was quite
fresh. Hence I proceeded to “Ullah bund,”
which I found to be composed of soft clay and
shells, elevated about ten feet from the surface
of the water, and cut through like a canal,
with perpendicular banks on either side. The
channel was about <i>thirty-five yards</i> broad, and
<i>three fathoms</i> deep; and a body of fresh water,
a portion of the real Indus, rolled down it into
the lake which I had traversed, below “Ullah
bund.” Here the stream took on once more
the appearance of a river, and I found several
boats laden with “ghee” (clarified butter),
which had descended it from Wunga, and thus
corroborated all which I had heard, that the
bunds of the Indus had been burst, and that
the communication between the great river and
its eastern and long-forsaken branch was once
more restored. I learned likewise that the far-famed
fortress of Omercote had been partially
overwhelmed in this inundation; for instead of
<i>being an öasis in the desert</i>, as had long been
supposed, this birthplace of the great Acbar is
a small brick fort only three or four miles distant
from the Indus, and between which and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
Lucput, so late as May, 1829, there was a communication
by water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ullah bund
described.</div>

<p>The “Ullah bund,” which I now examined
with attention, was, however, the most singular
consequence of this great earthquake. To the
eye it did not appear more elevated in one place
than another, and could be traced both east and
west as far as it could reach; the natives assigned
to it a total length of fifty miles. It must not,
however, be supposed to be a narrow stripe like
an artificial dam, as it extends inland to Raomaka-bazar,
perhaps to a breadth of sixteen miles,
and appeared to be a great upheaving of nature.
Its surface was covered with saline soil, and I
have already stated that it consisted of clay,
shells, and sand. The people universally attributed
this bund to the influence of the earthquake,
and also assigned the shallowness of the
river at Sundo to the same cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinions
regarding
the effects
of the
earthquake.</div>

<p>The inland lake which had been thus formed,
extended for about 2000 square miles, and its
limits were well defined, since the roads from
Cutch to Sinde passed on either side of it. The
one led from Nurra to Loonee and Raomaka-bazar,
and the other from Lucput to Kotree
Garee and the Jattee. I am disposed to believe
that this sheet of water has collected from a
depression of the country round Sindree; for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
earthquake had an immediate influence on the
channel of the river below “Ullah bund,” which
became deep enough to be navigable for boats
of 100 tons from the sea to Lucput, which had
never been the case since 1762. While the basin
of Sindree, as I may call it, was depressed, it is
evident that the mound of “Ullah bund” was
raised at the same time, as the description
already given will have satisfactorily shown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subsequent
alterations
in the
Indus.</div>

<p>In the month of August, in the year 1827, I
proceeded a second time to the eastern branch
of the Indus, to make further investigations regarding
a subject on which many individuals, as
well as myself, had taken an interest. Great
alterations had taken place in this changeable
country; the river and lake were deeper in all
places by two feet, the channel through “Ullah
bund” was much widened, and the sheet of
water was now entirely and every where salt.
The stream which passed “Ullah bund” was
fresh, but greatly diminished in size: in the
time that had intervened between my visits,
the south-westerly winds had prevailed, and
blown the sea water in upon the fresh, which,
appeared to account for the change that had
taken place.</p>

<p>Besides the facts which have been recorded,
it appears clear that a portion of the waters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
the Indus have a tendency to escape by Lucput
and Cutch. We find an inundation of the river
seeking an old channel which had been deserted
by them for sixty-five years.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>


<h3>THE RUN.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Run of
Cutch.</div>

<p>In the course of my observations on the Indus,
I found myself drawn into many inquiries regarding
the Run of Cutch, to which that river
adjoins; for if the alterations in the river afforded
room for remark, there was also much to be said
on the Run, which is a tract, I believe, without a
counterpart in the globe. In length, the Run
extends from the Indus to the western confines
of Guzerat, a distance of about 200 British
miles. In breadth, it is about thirty-five miles;
but there are, besides, various belts and ramifications,
which give it an extent of about 7000
square miles. It is accurately delineated in
the map. The whole tract may truly be said
to be a “terra hospitibus ferox;” fresh water
is never to be had any where but on islands,
and there it is scarce; it has no herbage,
and vegetable life is only discernible in the
shape of a stunted tamarisk bush, which thrives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
by its suction of the rain water that falls near
it. It differs as widely from what is termed
the sandy desert, as it differs from the cultivated
plain; neither does it resemble the Steppes
of Russia; but may be justly considered of a
nature peculiar to itself. It has been denominated
a marsh by geographers, which has
given rise to many erroneous impressions regarding
it. It has none of the characteristics
of one: it is not covered or saturated with water,
but at certain periods; it has neither weeds nor
grass in its bed, which, instead of being slimy,
is hard, dry, and sandy, of such a consistency as
never to become clayey, unless from a long continuance
of water on an individual spot; nor is it
otherwise fenny or swampy. It is a vast expanse
of flat, hardened, sand, encrusted with salt
sometimes an inch deep (the water having been
evaporated by the sun), and at others, beautifully
crystallized in large lumps. So much is
the whole surrounding country corrupted by
this exuberance of salt, that all the wells dug
on a level with the Run become salt. The
depression of the Run below the level of the
surrounding country at once suggests the probability
of its being a dried up lake or sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mirage of
the Run.</div>

<p>Nowhere is that singular phenomenon, the
<i>mirage or surab</i> of the desert, seen with greater
advantage than in the Run. The natives aptly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
term it smoke<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>; the smallest shrubs at a distance
assume the appearance of forests; and on
a nearer approach, sometimes that of ships in
full sail, at others that of breakers on a rock.
In one instance I observed a cluster of bushes,
which looked like a pier, with tall-masted vessels
lying close to it; and on approaching, not a bank
was near the shrubs to account for the deception.
From the Run, the hills of Cutch appear more
lofty, and to have merged into the clouds, their
bases being obscured by vapour. The wild ass<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
is the only inhabitant of this desolate region;
they roam about in flocks, “scorning the multitude
of the city, and make the wilderness
and barren lands their dwelling.” Their size
does not much exceed that of the common ass,
but, at a short distance, they sometimes appear as
large as elephants. While the sun shines, the whole
surrounding space of Run resembles a vast expanse
of water&mdash;the appearance it commonly
assumes&mdash;and which is only to be distinguished
from real water by those who are long habituated
to such visionary illusions. When the
sun is not shining, the Run appears higher at
a distance; but this has been remarked of the
sea, and other extensive sheets of water, and
is also to be accounted for in the deception of
vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span></p><div class="sidenote">Traditions
regarding
the Run.</div>

<p>The natives of Cutch, Mahommedans as well
as Hindoos, believe that the Run was formerly
a sea; and a tradition is in the mouth of every
one, that a Hindoo saint, by name Dhoorumnath,
a Jogee<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, underwent penance by standing on
his head for twelve years on the summit of
Denodur, one of the highest hills in Cutch,
which overlooks the Run. When his penance
terminated, God became visible to him, the hill
on which he stood split in two, and the adjacent
sea (the present Run) dried up; the ships and
boats which then navigated it were overturned,
its harbours destroyed, and many wonderful
events happened. There is no race of people who
have recourse to supernatural agency in their
chronicles, more than the natives of India; and,
to those accustomed to enquire into them, the
circumstances just recorded will appear as the
graft of one of their tales on some real event
which has actually occurred, and is thus transmitted
to posterity. Considering the frequent
occurrence of earthquakes in Cutch, the volcanic
appearance of’ its hills, and the lava which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
covers the face of the country, it is to a convulsion
of nature, in all probability, that we
are to attribute the foundation of such a tradition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concurring
traditions.</div>

<p>The natives, however, carry their traditions
beyond the vague legends of a saint, and point
out at this day different positions, said to have
been harbours, in the Run of Cutch. At Nerona,
which is a village about twenty miles NNW.
of Bhooj the capital, and close to the Run, there
is said to have been a sea-port, which is thus
described in the poesy of the <span class="lock">country:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nerona nuggartur</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Judhee Goontree Chitrano.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In other words, that Nerona was a sea-port (tur),
when Goontree (an ancient city in Cutch)
flourished in the neighbouring district of Chitrano.
At Charee, a village westward of Nerona,
and on the Run, there is also a like tradition.
The people of the Puchum, the largest island
on the Run, have similar traditions, and speak
of boats having been wrecked on the hills of the
island; also that there were considerable harbours
near them, called Dorut, Doh or Dohee, and
Phangwuro, which are yet pointed out to the
westward of Puchum. Bitaro, a small place on
the high road to Sinde, between Cutch and
“Ullah Bund,” is also said to have been a sea-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>port,
and I could point out several others. Nor
are the traditions less concurrent on the Sinde,
or northern side of the Run: Veego-gud, near
“Ullah Bund,” is said to have been the principal
sea-port, and its brick ruins are yet visible.
Vingur and Ballyaree, which lie eastward, claim
likewise the same privileges. This sea had the
name of “Kiln;” nor do I believe that the testimony
of so many people, regarding it, can be
discredited, informed as I was of these traditions
by different persons, who had no communication
with one another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
a late
earthquake
on the Run.</div>

<p>The effects of the earthquake of 1819 have
been already mentioned, in so far as relates to
the country adjoining the Indus; but occurrences
of an equally singular nature happened
farther eastward. It made numerous cracks or
fissures in the Run; and I state, on the authority
of eye-witnesses, that immense quantities of
black, muddy water were ejected from these
openings for a period of three days, and that
the water bubbled out of the wells of the tract
bordering on the Run, called Bunnee, till it
overwhelmed the country in some place with six,
and even ten feet of water. The shepherds
with difficulty saved themselves and their flocks.
During this time numerous pieces of iron and
ship-nails were thrown up at Phangwuro, the
sea-port before mentioned; and similar things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
have been since found in the same neighbourhood
while digging tanks. I give this fact on the
authority of respectable men at Nurra, who also
assured me that nothing of the kind had ever been
discovered before the earthquake of 1819.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flooding
of the Run.</div>

<p>The grand Run of Cutch is that part which
lies between Sinde and the islands of Puchum
and Khureer, the other parts being but ramifications
of it. It has a communication with the
sea both on the east and west, by means of the
Gulf of Cutch and a branch of the Indus, and
it is flooded from both these openings as soon as
the south-westerly winds set in, about April
each year. When local rain falls and moistens
the Run, the sea enters with great rapidity, and
insulates the province of Cutch for some months;
but even without rain the greater portion of the
Run is annually flooded. The level of the Run
is obviously higher than the sea, since it requires
strong winds to blow the waters of the ocean
over it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Configuration
of the
Run borders.</div>

<p>We must now attend to the configuration of
the Run. In the north-eastern extremity of
Cutch, it will be observed that a chain of hills
overhangs the Run at Bheyla: they are about
300 feet high, and terminate abruptly. The
islands of Khureer and Puchum lie due west of
this range, and are not only composed of the
same sort of ironstone as the Bheyla hills, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
have similar ranges running through their
northern extremities, which terminate, particularly
at Khureer, in a bluff and abrupt outline
towards the Run. Khureer is six miles westward
of Cutch, and Puchum is about sixteen
from Khureer; westward of Puchum there are
a few low and sandy islets on the Run, and
south of it lies the Bunnee, an extensive tract
of grassland, of greater elevation than the Run,
but not sufficiently so to yield grain. It has
many wells, and is inhabited by a pastoral race.
South of Khureer there are also many islands,
the largest of which is Gangta, and covered
with rocky hills. Between Guzerat and Cutch
the Run is narrow; at Addysir it is but a mile and
a half wide to the island of Chorar. Here there
is a deposit of shells and marine matter, a carbonate
of lime mixed with other substances; it
has a red and yellow petrified appearance, takes
on a tolerably good polish, and from which some
members of the faithful pretend to read Arabic
words, or letters of the Koran. It was used in
the mosaic works of all the Moghul emperors,
and is commonly called Dookur-warra marble
by Europeans. North of the Bheyla hills lies
Parkur, a district peninsulated by the Run,
having the lofty hills of Kalinjur, of a formation
differing from Cutch, where they are almost all
sandstone. They are primitive rocks, rising in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
small cones one upon another, as if they had
dropped from the clouds; the summit is composed
of trap, which extends for about a third of
the way down, and the base is red granite, which
rings when struck. These hills are separated
from Cutch by a low tract of the Run, upwards of
thirty miles broad, without an intervening bush.
The whole northern face of Cutch, from Bheyla
on the east to Lucput on the west, presents,
with a few exceptions, either a rocky or an elevated
bank. From Nurra to Lucput the rocks terminate
abruptly, and form what would be called
capes, cliffs, and promontories, if the water
washed under them. When the immediate
vicinity of the Run is not of this description,
it stretches inland, exactly as water would do
when not resisted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Run supposed
to
have been
an inland
sea.</div>

<p>The sea is receding from the southern shores
of Cutch; and I believe it is a generally received
conclusion, that there is a depression of its level
throughout the globe, though in some places it
has risen. We may, therefore, suppose the
ocean to have receded from the Run of Cutch,
and that that tract was at one time a navigable
sea. That the natives should attribute so
great a change in a part of their country to
the influence of a Jogee, is not wonderful. A
body of these persons has been long settled in
Cutch. They are a philanthropic and hospi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>table
body of men, who permit no one of any
persuasion to leave their door hungry, and they
are blessed with plenty. Like the monks in
Europe in former days, these Jogees are the
repository of history and traditions, and it may
be their careful preservation of them, which
has given rise to the belief that the alterations
in the Run were accomplished in the time
of Dhoorumnath, the founder of their order.
In proof of this, they have a tradition that the
ancestors of the present rulers of Cutch were
once a class of poor shepherds from Samee
(Tatta), in Sinde, and fed their flocks, till
patronised by the Denodur Jogees, who raised
them to be Rajahs of the country. So far is this
true, the Rajpoots of Cutch did come from
Tatta, and did tend herds of cattle in Cutch;
but they were certainly not raised to their present
elevation by the intercession of some Hindoo
monks; yet such is the alteration which a story
undergoes, in the course of four hundred years.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span></p>

<h3>NOTE ON SINDREE.</h3>

<p>I annex the following extract, describing a
journey from Lucput in Cutch, to Hydrabad in
Sinde, by way of Sindree, from the MS. of
Captain R. M. Grindlay, written in the year
1808, when with a mission to the Ameers of
Sinde, and which has been kindly furnished to
me. It will be seen that the neighbourhood of
Sindree, which I have described to be under
water, was then dry, and that the fort of Sindree
existed at that time, as an outpost of the Cutch
Government.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We embarked on the creek at Lucput Bender,
which is about three quarters of a mile broad, and
runs between east and north, for six or eight miles,
when it begins to narrow very much: the shore on
each side is a wet marsh, covered with short bushes.</p>

<p>“In the evening we anchored at the turn of the tide,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
and at twelve o’clock next day we passed Sindree,
which is about thirty miles from Lucput, and dependent
on it, with a small garrison of sepoys: it is a small
fort, with a few huts outside, and one well: the creek
here is about a mile and a quarter broad, and has a
ferry across. The travellers who take this route to
Sinde are not numerous, and leave no vestige of a
road in the light sand, of which the dry part of the
Run is composed. The heat of the meridian sun is said
to be so intense, that they generally travel in the
night. From Sindree, by land, the next stage is about
twenty-four miles to Baura, after which the Run ends,
and water becomes tolerably plentiful.</p>

<p>“We passed Sindree, and observed several inferior
branches leading through the Run, among which we
saw a few straggling men and women; about twenty
miles beyond Sindree, we reached Aly Bunder, at
eight o’clock at night, and came to anchor close to the
mound which confines the fresh water: when the day
appeared, we observed it to be a poor mud village, of
about fifty huts, and a tower of the same unsubstantial
materials. Here we encamped for the purpose
of collecting the boats from the freshwater side of the
mound, and not finding a sufficient number, several
of those we brought with us were dragged over: this,
however, was a work of three days; and, during that
time, from the nature of the soil, we were annoyed by
the dust in such a manner as would scarcely be
believed by those who had not been in a similar
situation: the sun was completely obscured by it,
an object at the distance of 100 yards was invisible;
and the natives moving about were so disguised, that
their colour was not distinguishable. The soil of the
Run is a mixture of fine sand and the salt deposited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
by the inundation. This, dried by several months’ sun,
becomes a most impalpable powder. The Run, which
ceases about a line with Aly Bunder, from north-east
and north, is covered with aquatic bushes and a few
shells: the sand entangled amongst these bushes forms
hillocks of various heights, from five to fifteen feet,
according to the size of the bush. It does not appear
that any of the side channels lead beyond the
Run, or that any of them are navigated by boats,
except those which again join the main stream: that
by which we came is certainly by far the most considerable.</p>

<p>“On the 10th we embarked again on the freshwater
river, which is there about 400 yards broad, and soon
after widens very much, with high sand-hills on the
banks, and a few huts with a little cultivation. The
river here takes the name of Goonee.</p>

<p>“At the distance of about twelve miles from Aly
Bunder, the river divides, and soon after becomes so
narrow, that our boats, though not large, had difficulty
in passing through the large bushes which overhang
the bank, and has great appearance of a cut canal, or
at least of a channel cleared out and deepened; the
banks are irregular in their height, and the land
immediately beyond them low, and in several places
swampy. We passed the mouth of a creek on the
west, said to lead to Tatta, besides several other inferior
streams which run through the country, and are
cut into a variety of channels, for the purposes of
cultivation.</p>

<p>“About ten miles beyond Aly Bunder, on the west
bank, is Chuttee Thur (or ferry), opposite to which is
the mouth of a considerable stream, with a dam across,
which we understood to be the Phoran. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
formerly a very large branch of the Indus, and ran
past Nusserpoor, which I learn is to the south-east.
Many of the inhabitants of that place recollect a
remarkable change in the river: the inundation swallowed
up a great part of the town, and altered the
course of the river, which since then has had much
less water in it. The whole of Sinde, from the nature
of its soil, is subject to these alterations by the annual
floods, many striking instances of which the inhabitants
are well acquainted with, particularly that which
I have already mentioned, and the great alterations in
the branches below Tatta.”&mdash;<i>See Captain Grindley’s

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> This limited extent of the delta of the Indus is quite
inconsistent with the dimensions assigned to it by the Greeks.
Arrian informs us that the two great branches below Pattala
are about 1800 stadia distant from each other, “and so much
is the extent of the island Pattala along the sea coast.”
The distance of 125 British miles, the face of the modern
delta, does not amount to 1125 stadia, or little more than
one half the assigned distance of Arrian. On this point the
Greeks had not personal observation to guide them, since
Nearchus sailed out of the western branch of the Indus, and
Alexander made but a three days’ journey between the two
branches of the river, and could not have entered Cutch, as
has been surmised by Dr. Vincent.</p>

oppress them.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> I have since found, in some manuscript papers of the
late lamented Captain M‘Murdo, written as long since as
1815, that he formed similar conclusions with myself regarding
the Run of Cutch. He is treating of that part of
it near Kattywar, of which I have not spoken, and the following
extract is both curious and satisfactory:&mdash;-</p>

<p>“The Runn has every appearance of the sea having
shortly withdrawn from it. This is supported by the
semblance and production of the neighbouring country,
and large stones are found on the shore several miles from
the present Runn, of a description similar to those used
as anchors; they have holes bored through for the cable.
On the shore, at different places, are shown small ancient
buildings, called Dan Derees, or houses where the dan
or customs were collected; and, in short, it is a tradition
in the country, that Khor, a village two miles east of
Teekir, was a sea-port town. About fifty years since, the
wreck of a vessel, of a size far beyond that of any of the
craft now in use in the Gulf of Cutch, was discovered at
Wawania, sunk in the mud about fifteen feet deep.”&mdash;<i>Captain
M‘Murdo’s MS. Memoir on Kattywar, August, 1815.</i></p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
